      "Course: Objects in Context. An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Ancient World\n",
      "Objectives: A distinct feature of Ancient Studies is the combined use of written and material sources. In this course the focus is on material culture, and how this can be used as a source of information about the past. You will familiarize yourself with some of the main categories of objects such as statues, reliefs, coins and utensils as well as with complex assemblages that are part of the sacred, domestic and funerary domain. An important issue is how we evaluate objects as sources of historical information about the past. What are the possibilities and limitations? What types of questions can we ask? For this we take a closer look at the historical context of material sources: we explore why material culture was created by people in the past, and how this affects our image of antiquity. Special attention will be paid to confronting material and literary information, and to those cases where they seem to contradict each other.\n",
      "At the end of this course, you can:\n",
      "evaluate various categories of objects as sources of historical information about the past\n",
      "explain basic theories regarding the use of objects as historical source\n",
      "apply these insights to an actual object\n",
      "find relevant scholarship and primary sources\n",
      "write a brief annotated academic text\n",
      "Content snippet: In this course you will familiarize yourself with some basic theories regarding the use of material sources to generate information about the past. In addition to this, you will perform your own research on selected objects from the archaeological collection of the Allard Pierson. Doing so, you will get acquainted with the university library and acquire basic academic skills such as how to draft a\n",
      "Course: The Classical Canon I: The Heritage of Antiquity\n",
      "Objectives: This first canon module (followed up by a module in year 2 for regular students, but also set up as ‘stand alone’ elective) gives an introduction to the texts, items, places and monuments that belong to the 'Classical' canon, or have once belonged to it. After a general introduction, it offers broad outlines of the contents, contexts and uses of canonical works, persons and events, such as the Bible, the Gilgamesh epos, Homer, Virgil, ancient tragedians and lyricists, the Athenian Akropolis, the Ara Pacis, the battle of Thermopylai etc. Examples will be taken from literature, archaeology, history, history of art and urban studies, or regard so-called lieux de mémoire. They will be ordered thematically in combinations of several items. A lecture is devoted a single theme or a category of canonical works, persons or events, suggesting links and connections between them. The examples will normally be taken from the ancient world, but they will be viewed in the perspective of the roles they have played in later times, and of their roles in the formation of later canons. Reception of canonical items and their continuous presence through time are an important focus of the module.\n",
      "Acquiring basic knowledge about the (various) contents, cultural contexts, causes and uses of (the) classical canon(s);\n",
      "Being able to reproduce an overview of the main constituents of the present day ‘classical canon’ from the Ancient Near East to Late Antiquity\n",
      "Being able to reproduce a basic chronology; to distinguish various ‘genres’/disciplines; an to generally contextualise various canons and their functions, and canonical items within that\n",
      "Being able to switch between various ‘genres’/disciplines/artistic media/periods/cultural areas\n",
      "Being able to identify specific and more general parts of the canon\n",
      "Content snippet: This course prepares for the module ‘Canon II’ on modern theory concerning canons and canonicity, but can also be taken as a separate (elective) module. Besides reading texts relevant to the case studies, students will have to present a case study in a group presentation.\n"
