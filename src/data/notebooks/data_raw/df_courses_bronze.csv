What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source.

They are able to evaluate research papers related to their own discipline from a theoretical/methodological point of view and to form an opinion/take a position in discussions about this among peers.\nHave practiced academic writing skills and processing feedback while completing the weekly seminar assignments and leading up to the final assignment. They can reflect critically in writing on the research papers they have read and processed.\nGLTC-students (and Ancient Studies students specializing in either Latin or Greek) have gained practical experience with codicology, paleography, text-criticism and literary criticism and are able to reflect critically on methods and theoretical viewpoints in these domains."", ""Course Content\nModern academic disciplines are shaped and structured by philosophical concepts and doctrines. This course provides an overview of the history of philosophical thoughts and of philosophical debates about methodology, and their relevance to discussions of methodology, interdisciplinarity, and resource use in philology, cultural history, and archeology of antiquity.\nThe general theoretical and methodological issues that form the basis of the historical development of science and humanities will be related to the study of the past through texts and material culture. Disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches will be discussed, with special attention to both limitations and possibilities.\nThis course consists of one lecture and one seminar per week. The lectures are taught by a lecturer of the Department of Philosophy, on the base of a handbook. The seminars are taught by a lecturer from ACASA, and devoted to the discussion of a selection of key themes and relevant articles. Students will be trained in the close reading of philosophical texts that are crucial to the way their (inter)discipline organizes, produces, and structures knowledge.\nStudents in the programmes of GLTC and Ancient Studies students specializing in either Latin or Greek follow a different seminar, in which the historical developments of the humanities disciplines are more specifically connected to the field of classics. They will focus on (and practice) paleography, text criticism and literary theory."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nWeekly lectures (2 hours/week); weekly seminars (2 hours/week)"", ""Method of Assessment\nThere will be a written exam for all students based on the handbook and the lectures.

During the discussion, a lawyer pointed out some legal issues and cautiously began, “I know you don’t want to hear this from a lawyer, but…” Before he could continue, another board member cut him off aggressively: “…then shut the f*** up.” This attitude was common among computer scientists as well. While developers and designers focused on what was possible, lawyers concentrated on what was permissible, often without attempting to understand the potential of the technology.\nToday, the situation is no longer black and white, but rather gray. Lawyers understand technology and development processes better, and AI specialists understand the need to comply with the law. Technology and the law are no longer systematically seen as adversaries. Against this backdrop, many governments around the world are launching initiatives to regulate AI. Their goal is often to contain high-risk AI while supporting other AI applications. One such example is the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act.\nThis course explores how AI is governed by legal rules and standards. By the end of the course, students will have a solid grasp of the EU AI Act, including the constraints it imposes on AI development and its key limitations. This will put them in a unique position to contribute to the development of legally compliant AI systems.

This course will address various aspects that come into play when physically present robots interact with humans. This course focuses mainly on social robots, humanoids in particular, suited for communicative purposes. We will discuss both sides of the coin: perspectives from the robot-side as well as perspectives from the user-side. Differences and similarities with common computer-based AI (cf. avatars, chatbots) are discussed in comparison to human-robot interaction, exemplified by main application areas (e.g., eldercare, education). Basic models and relevant aspects of the psychology of the user and ethical aspects are also discussed. If robots start talking to humans by themselves, how can they understand each other? Lectures will therefore also address the basics of the understanding of language (e.g., Natural Language Processing (NLP)).

Endrullis,"Seminar, Lecture",Hide full list (4); Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science; Mathematics,"[""Course Objective\nThe first part of the course, on automata and languages, deals with the. concepts of formal language, grammar, and automaton. Two types of languages are covered: regular and context-free languages. Regular. languages in the form of regular expressions are ubiquitous in computer science. They are used in search queries and text manipulation.\nContext-free languages and grammars (e.g. the Backus–Naur form) are the prevailing standards for describing programming languages. We also discuss parsing algorithms to determine whether a given string is in a context-free language. The automata-theoretic counterparts for regular and context-free languages are finite automata and the more powerful pushdown automata.\nThe students will learn to:\ndesign finite automata and create regular expressions for a given regular language, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to translate between finite automata, right-linear grammars, and regular expressions, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to make automata deterministic and minimal, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\ndesign pushdown automata and create context-free grammars for a given context-free language, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to translate between pushdown automata and context-free grammars, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\nuse pumping lemmas to reason about whether a language is regular or context-free, [Applying knowledge and understanding] [Making judgements]\napply algorithms for parsing context-free languages. [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\nIn the second part of the course, on computability theory, the central question is: what computations can be performed on a computer? To reason about computability, we introduce the mathematical model of Turing machines and discuss the Church-Turing thesis.

Endrullis,"Seminar, Lecture",Hide full list (4); Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science; Mathematics,"[""Course Objective\nThe first part of the course, on automata and languages, deals with the. concepts of formal language, grammar, and automaton. Two types of languages are covered: regular and context-free languages. Regular. languages in the form of regular expressions are ubiquitous in computer science. They are used in search queries and text manipulation.\nContext-free languages and grammars (e.g. the Backus–Naur form) are the prevailing standards for describing programming languages. We also discuss parsing algorithms to determine whether a given string is in a context-free language. The automata-theoretic counterparts for regular and context-free languages are finite automata and the more powerful pushdown automata.\nThe students will learn to:\ndesign finite automata and create regular expressions for a given regular language, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to translate between finite automata, right-linear grammars, and regular expressions, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to make automata deterministic and minimal, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\ndesign pushdown automata and create context-free grammars for a given context-free language, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\napply algorithms to translate between pushdown automata and context-free grammars, [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\nuse pumping lemmas to reason about whether a language is regular or context-free, [Applying knowledge and understanding] [Making judgements]\napply algorithms for parsing context-free languages. [Knowledge and understanding] [Applying knowledge and understanding]\nIn the second part of the course, on computability theory, the central question is: what computations can be performed on a computer? To reason about computability, we introduce the mathematical model of Turing machines and discuss the Church-Turing thesis. We discuss examples of undecidable problems: the halting problem and the Post correspondence problem. It is shown how the undecidability of new problems can be shown by reduction from a known undecidable problem. Finally, we discuss a classification of decidable/computable problems into important complexity classes, notably P, NP, and NP-complete problems, together with the corresponding reduction arguments.\nThe students will learn to:\nreason whether a given problem is decidable (computable) or undecidable (not computable), [Making judgements]\nunderstand the classification of decidable problems in the complexity hierarchy (e.g. P, NP, EXP) of, and [Knowledge and understanding]\nreason about the complexity of a problem via the reduction to/from problems with known complexity.
