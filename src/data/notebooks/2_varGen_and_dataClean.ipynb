In this course the focus is on material culture, and how this can be used as a source of information about the past. You will familiarize yourself with some of the main categories of objects such as statues, reliefs, coins and utensils as well as with complex assemblages that are part of the sacred, domestic and funerary domain. An important issue is how we evaluate objects as sources of historical information about the past. What are the possibilities and limitations? What types of questions can we ask? For this we take a closer look at the historical context of material sources: we explore why material culture was created by people in the past, and how this affects our image of antiquity. Special attention will be paid to confronting material and literary information, and to those cases where they seem to contradict each other.\nAt the end of this course, you can:\nevaluate various categories of objects as sources of historical information about the past\nexplain basic theories regarding the use of objects as historical source\napply these insights to an actual object\nfind relevant scholarship and primary sources\nwrite a brief annotated academic text",

In other words: how does research into the past work? The first-year module ‘Historical sources’ introduces all students of Classical philology, Archaeology and Ancient Studies to the process of research into the past, with a particular focus on the role of sources. For all knowledge of the past starts from the analysis of primary sources: relics of the past, whether surviving by accident or carefully transmitted.\nAt the end of this module, students are able to:\nidentify and execute the consecutive steps of the process of research into the past\nidentify various types of primary sources from the Ancient World, using the appropriate academic terms\ndiscuss the typical features, potential and limitations of the types of historical sources studied in class\napply source criticism to historical sources\nassess the value of different types of primary sources for different research questions, and to explain the advantages of combining multiple types of sources (multi-disciplinarity)",
         "In this module, students are introduced to the whole spectrum of primary sources, the ways these have reached us, and the consequences of this process of survival for their potential and validity. The focus will lay on textual and iconographic sources from Classical Antiquity, such as historiographical texts, inscriptions, documents on papyrus and coins. What are their special features? What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source. Various sources can complement and enrich our picture of the past, as will be shown throughout the module by means of interesting and interdisciplinary case studies. When visiting the historical location of one of these cases, you even will personally experience the added value of such an interdisciplinary approach.",

         "This course is designed to teach students with no prior knowledge of Semitic languages to read Akkadian. First attested around 2300 BCE and last used in the first century CE, Akkadian has a tremendously rich history. It was written on clay tablets, using a script we call ‘cuneiform’ (from Latin cuneus meaning ‘wedge-shaped’). Cuneiform tablets survive not only from Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) but also from Syria, Turkey and Egypt and they tell us about all imaginable aspects of human life in ancient times: how cities and states were organized, how great battles were fought and won, which laws governed societies, people's beliefs about gods and even what kind of songs they listened to or how they cooked their meals. Throughout this course you will learn a basic repertoire of cuneiform signs so that by the end, you will be able to decipher and read some of these ancient texts yourself!\nTime permitting, students will have a guided tour of the VU special collections, during which they will have the opportunity to engage with actual ancient cuneiform tablets.",

Students who attend class, participate by asking and answering questions, and do the assigned reading and exercises have historically done well in this course, even if its subject matter is unfamiliar.\nWritten examination (60%)\nStudents will be tested on their command of the grammar, signs and vocabulary as taught in the course.

You examine the material and textual sources for our knowledge of antiquity. You follow courses such as The Classical Canon 1: The Heritage of Antiquity about the canon, as well as courses on ancient philosophy and on cultural contacts between the Middle East and the Mediterranean region. You can also take elective courses to figure out which specialisation you would like to follow later.",
         "In your second and third year, you will follow interdisciplinary modules ‘Cultural Contact: Mediterranean Connections’, which concerns the interaction between the inhabitants of the Mediterranean region; ‘Religion in Antiquity’; and ‘Lieux de mémoire’, in which you study the way in which places gain importance because people connect stories to them. At the end of the second year you will go on a trip to Sicily, together with students of Archaeology and Classics. You also dive into your chosen specialisation of Latin.",

The programme is structured in such a way that you can increasingly focus on your own interests. Because the Archaeology programme works closely with the Bachelor’s programmes in Ancient Studies and in Greek & Latin Language & Culture, the first year is broad in scope. You study the field of archaeology and learn about contemporary societies in Europe. You also delve into cultural history and sources since antiquity, in connection with the natural landscape. This year concludes with fieldwork, during which you are familiarised with excavation techniques. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide.",
         "The second year deepens your knowledge of archaeology, focusing on the themes of urban culture, rituals, religions and heritage. You study a range of archaeological artefacts and learn different academic and digital research methods. You also go on an excursion, and end the year with an internship or fieldwork. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide.",

You also take two courses focused on developing your research skills: Death and Commemoration, on how people have historically dealt with death, and Lieux de Mémoire, on historical and contemporary spaces used for the purposes of commemoration. Finally, you write your Bachelor’s thesis on a topic of your own choosing within the field of archaeology. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide."

In the first semester, you’ll get an introduction to intelligent systems, and take foundational courses in programming, computational thinking and psychology. You’ll even build a computer program that plays a card game, contributing your first-hand research to an unsolved problem. The second semester is about interaction: how to build a computer program that understands how to interact and collaborate with humans.",
         "In the second year, 40% of the courses are common to both tracks, including statistics, linear algebra and Machine Learning. In the Socially Aware Computing track, you’ll also learn about AI’s applications in the context of health and law. For example, you’ll work with health science students on projects, bringing your AI knowledge to bear – you might be making hospital ward scheduling more efficient, for instance, or finding ways to help elderly people remember to take their pills.",

Many students choose to go abroad to do their minor, studying things like computer science, data science, programming or other related disciplines at other universities. In the second semester, you’ll take core courses in Cognitive Psychology, Ethical AI and Research Design. In parallel with writing your Bachelor’s thesis, you’ll take a course on Research Design to support you during your final project."

In the first semester you learn to work with statistics and models involving uncertainty. In the second semester you focus on different aspects of data and data analysis. You also further develop your programming skills in the Advanced Programming course and learn to program in Python.",

This is a practical case study on a topic such as the pricing of cargo for transportation by air. Which price do you use for which destination? How do the weight of the cargo and the date of the flight factor in? What is an acceptable price? Using data and algorithms, you come up with innovative solutions."

Afterwards, you will be further trained in computer science, econometrics, machine learning and statistics. These are important tools in our data driven society to analyze and understand, for instance, financial and economic data and to make predictions for such data.\nFor instance, how to design machine learning methods that ensure that all customers in the financial sector have fair access to financial services, regardless of their background? Thanks to super fast computers the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has a large data set with hundreds of macroeconomic variables. Which traps are there when analyzing such big data and how to avoid them?\n\nYou will attend lectures covering theoretical concepts, engage in group assignments, analyze case studies, and gain firsthand experience with various companies. Your instructors are experts at the forefront of their respective fields, actively participating in research, and some also hold positions in the business sector when not teaching at the university. This dual involvement ensures that the program remains both relevant and up to date. The Econometrics and Data Science programme has been rated as a “topopleiding” high quality education by the Keuzegids Universiteiten four years in a row.

Plus, you will study the ethical dilemmas behind using data.
