The course delivers a concise introduction to material sources and materiality as core concepts of archaeology training as well as an introduction to ways of dealing scientifically with material sources.\nThe introduction into academic skills focuses on reading and processing and searching and justifying as formulated in the ACASA Academic skills pathway. Students practice summarizing readings, learn how to deal with footnotes and bibliographies, learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources, and are introduced to the relevant collections (physical, UB and online). Fraud and plagiarism are also highlighted.\nAfter completing this course students will be able to:\ndescribe the possibilities and limitations of the most important categories of archaeological sources;\nsplit an archaeological assemblage into different categories of material culture;\nexplain the theoretical and methodological differences in the approach to archaeological sources;\ncritically review the characterisation and subsequent relative dating of archaeological contexts;\nexplain research methodology with respect to research question and scale of analysis;\napply basic academic skills in their work.",
         "Materiality in archaeology concerns not simply the physical matter of artefacts but the fundamental interactions between humans and materials through time. The processes through which humans turn materials into objects, from selection and manipulation to use and discard, provides a valuable, tangible source of information on past human behaviour and interaction. But the story does not end there, as these objects in turn interact with each other and humans to shape our lived experiences. Using the world-leading reference collections housed within ACASA as a primary resource, students will become familiar with different types of archaeological sources, their (raw) materials and how archaeologists approach these sources at different scales of analysis – artefact, assemblage, industry/technology – as well as the range of techniques used to observe and classify these sources.\nThe following questions will be answered:\nwhat different kinds of information do unworked and worked materials offer as archaeological sources?\nhow do humans turn (raw) materials into objects?\nhow can materials play a role in the frequency and visibility of different archaeological sources in the archaeological record?\nhow do objects affect social, religious, economic and political aspects of past societies?\nhow do archaeologists present and discuss their research into different archaeological sources?",

In this course you will be introduced to the methods and theories used in this field of archaeology and learn how to put them to use to answer questions on the interrelationship between humans and their environment.\nIn this course, four aspects of the interrelationship between humans and their environment will be discussed:\nNatural and human-induced processes in the formation of the landscape;\nSpatial imaging of the landscape: the use of maps;\nPlants and animals in the landscape and their exploitation;\nHumans in the landscape: environmental reconstruction and food economy.",

         "The days of classical antiquity are irretrievably gone. So how can we know anything about this intriguing world? How do new and changed insights about Antiquity come about? In other words: how does research into the past work? The first-year module ‘Historical sources’ introduces all students of Classical philology, Archaeology and Ancient Studies to the process of research into the past, with a particular focus on the role of sources. For all knowledge of the past starts from the analysis of primary sources: relics of the past, whether surviving by accident or carefully transmitted.\nAt the end of this module, students are able to:\nidentify and execute the consecutive steps of the process of research into the past\nidentify various types of primary sources from the Ancient World, using the appropriate academic terms\ndiscuss the typical features, potential and limitations of the types of historical sources studied in class\napply source criticism to historical sources\nassess the value of different types of primary sources for different research questions, and to explain the advantages of combining multiple types of sources (multi-disciplinarity)",
         "In this module, students are introduced to the whole spectrum of primary sources, the ways these have reached us, and the consequences of this process of survival for their potential and validity. The focus will lay on textual and iconographic sources from Classical Antiquity, such as historiographical texts, inscriptions, documents on papyrus and coins. What are their special features? What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source. Various sources can complement and enrich our picture of the past, as will be shown throughout the module by means of interesting and interdisciplinary case studies. When visiting the historical location of one of these cases, you even will personally experience the added value of such an interdisciplinary approach.",

The programme is structured in such a way that you can increasingly focus on your own interests. Because the Archaeology programme works closely with the Bachelor’s programmes in Ancient Studies and in Greek & Latin Language & Culture, the first year is broad in scope. You study the field of archaeology and learn about contemporary societies in Europe. You also delve into cultural history and sources since antiquity, in connection with the natural landscape. This year concludes with fieldwork, during which you are familiarised with excavation techniques. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide.",
         "The second year deepens your knowledge of archaeology, focusing on the themes of urban culture, rituals, religions and heritage. You study a range of archaeological artefacts and learn different academic and digital research methods. You also go on an excursion, and end the year with an internship or fieldwork. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide.",
         "In the third year, you can follow aminorto either explore a different field of study or dive deeper into a specific subject. You also take two courses focused on developing your research skills: Death and Commemoration, on how people have historically dealt with death, and Lieux de Mémoire, on historical and contemporary spaces used for the purposes of commemoration. Finally, you write your Bachelor’s thesis on a topic of your own choosing within the field of archaeology. Read the complete course overview in theStudy guide."

In the first semester, you’ll get an introduction to intelligent systems, and take foundational courses in programming, computational thinking and psychology. You’ll even build a computer program that plays a card game, contributing your first-hand research to an unsolved problem. The second semester is about interaction: how to build a computer program that understands how to interact and collaborate with humans.",
         "In the second year, 40% of the courses are common to both tracks, including statistics, linear algebra and Machine Learning. In the Socially Aware Computing track, you’ll also learn about AI’s applications in the context of health and law. For example, you’ll work with health science students on projects, bringing your AI knowledge to bear – you might be making hospital ward scheduling more efficient, for instance, or finding ways to help elderly people remember to take their pills.",

Many students choose to go abroad to do their minor, studying things like computer science, data science, programming or other related disciplines at other universities. In the second semester, you’ll take core courses in Cognitive Psychology, Ethical AI and Research Design. In parallel with writing your Bachelor’s thesis, you’ll take a course on Research Design to support you during your final project."

Plus, you will study the ethical dilemmas behind using data. You will work on real life case studies in small groups, in which you will use the data analysis techniques you have learned to develop practical solutions.
