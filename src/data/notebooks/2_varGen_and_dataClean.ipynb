    "For instance, how to design machine learning methods that ensure that all customers in the financial sector have fair access to financial services, regardless of their background? Thanks to super fast computers the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has a large data set with hundreds of macroeconomic variables. Which traps are there when analyzing such big data and how to avoid them?\n",

    "You will attend lectures covering theoretical concepts, engage in group assignments, analyze case studies, and gain firsthand experience with various companies. Your instructors are experts at the forefront of their respective fields, actively participating in research, and some also hold positions in the business sector when not teaching at the university. This dual involvement ensures that the program remains both relevant and up to date. The Econometrics and Data Science programme has been rated as a “topopleiding” high quality education by the Keuzegids Universiteiten four years in a row. Kraket, our active study association, adds a fun social side to your programme, organizes careers events, invites representatives from large companies such as KLM, and even plans trips to companies abroad!\n",
