    "**Idea**: Lexicon score, concept and math\\\n",
    "RIASEC gives six interest areas Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional. O*NET’s Interest Profiler materials define these areas and show example activities and descriptors that map to each one. We will build a small dictionary of words and short phrases for each area, then score any program text by how much of that text overlaps with each dictionary. That gives a six number vector per program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let each course produce a continuous six number vector, then aggregate with weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per course vector v_course = scores from the lexicon over that course description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight per course w = ECTS credits times a year factor. For year weight use 1.0 for year 1, 0.6 for year 2, 0.4 for year 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programme course vector V_courses = weighted average of v_course over all required courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programme vector V_programme = 0.4 × scores from programme description plus 0.6 × V_courses.\n",
    "Tune these weights later using advisor feedback.\n",

    "1. **Preprocess the text**\n",
    "Lowercase, strip markup, keep words, optional lemmatize.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose a lexicon for each letter**\n",
    "Example for Investigative might include analyze, theory, model, hypothesis, data, experiment. The O*NET Interest Profiler explains what belongs under each area and gives good guidance for building such seed sets.\n",

    "3. **Weight the words**\n",
    "    Two simple choices:\n",
    "    a. Raw counts per thousand tokens\n",
    "    b. TF IDF weights which downweight very common words and upweight informative ones\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Aggregate to the six areas**\n",
    "For a program p and letter L, the raw score is the sum of weights for all tokens that appear in the L lexicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalize**\n",
