In this course the focus is on material culture, and how this can be used as a source of information about the past. You will familiarize yourself with some of the main categories of objects such as statues, reliefs, coins and utensils as well as with complex assemblages that are part of the sacred, domestic and funerary domain. An important issue is how we evaluate objects as sources of historical information about the past. What are the possibilities and limitations? What types of questions can we ask? For this we take a closer look at the historical context of material sources: we explore why material culture was created by people in the past, and how this affects our image of antiquity. Special attention will be paid to confronting material and literary information, and to those cases where they seem to contradict each other.\nAt the end of this course, you can:\nevaluate various categories of objects as sources of historical information about the past\nexplain basic theories regarding the use of objects as historical source\napply these insights to an actual object\nfind relevant scholarship and primary sources\nwrite a brief annotated academic text"", ""Course Content\nIn this course you will familiarize yourself with some basic theories regarding the use of material sources to generate information about the past.

The focus will lay on textual and iconographic sources from Classical Antiquity, such as historiographical texts, inscriptions, documents on papyrus and coins. What are their special features? What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source.

In Western culture, the rebirth of Classical culture was proudly claimed by all who sought to establish their authority or legitimize power, from the Carolingian Empire to papal Rome, and from the Ancien Régime to the Third Reich.

How has the Classical heritage been tended, interpreted, appropriated or rejected through the centuries? On the other hand, a number of thematic sessions will explore specific topics from a diachronic perspective. In general, these will be discussed using a case study in which various elements play a role: texts as well as material sources (e.g. visual art, architecture).

Emphasis will be on the identification of different heritage categories (tangible and intangible) and above all heritage paradigms, from protectionist and conservationist traditions to developmental approaches focusing on the contribution of heritage to socioeconomic and spatial development. In particular, we will explore in this course how these categories and paradigms have relevance for the study of antiquity and archaeology. Central concepts which will be addressed are: heritage, landscape, value, authenticity, appropriation, public participation, conflict, tourism. These will be illustrated and explained through a series of case studies in seminar classes. Particular attention will be paid to the specific role of archaeological heritage in the broader heritage discourse and frameworks."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nIn the first two weeks, there are four classes on a specific theme on a theoretical and practical level. For each class, there will be compulsory reading made available through the Canvas site. Each class will consist of a lecture (ca 1 hr) followed by group discussions.\nIn the third week, there will be no class, but you are supposed to work on the assignment: make an application document for a topic on the ACASA Heritage List.\nIn the fourth-seventh week the first classes of the week will be regular classes on a specific theme, with assigned compulsory reading. The second classes will be devoted to pitches for the ACASA Heritage List. At the end of these classes, we will vote which topics should be on the ACASA Heritage List. The final vote for the definitive ACASA Heritage List will be done in the last class, followed by discussion."", ""Method of Assessment\nThe compulsory literature will be assessed by a weekly exam question that you will have to submit through the canvas page (completed/ non-completed).\nEach student will work out a specific case-study for the ACASA Heritage List. In a pitch of 5-7 minutes, you will present your case (graded). Moreover, you will be asked to react to pitches of your fellow students (non-graded). In case of a student failing this part of the course, an additional extended paper on a different topic will need to be submitted.\nIn every class, there will be discussion and the final class will be a discussion class.

These aspects will be studied in two ways: on the one hand we browse chronologically through a series of decisive moments in canon formation, from antiquity to the present day; on the other hand we will present a representative selection of theoretical concepts – from philosophy, sociology and art history – that will enable you to gain insights into content and function of canons and the mechanisms of cultural selection.

The meaning of the concept of (World) heritage has radically changed throughout the last decades; whilst initially World Heritage designations were limited to objects and buildings, increasingly sites and (cultural) landscapes are considered as well. There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past. During this course, conflicts will be addressed by discussing case studies, visiting heritage sites, reflecting on the way in which UNESCO seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage of “outstanding value to humanity”, and debating how heritage is co-created in national and local scales."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars, excursions."", ""Method of Assessment\nGroup assignment during seminar 1 (15%): learning objectives 2, 3, and 5\nGroup assignment during seminar 2 (15%): learning objectives 1, 4, and 5\nGroup assignment during self-guided excursion (15%): learning objectives 3 and 4\nIndividual essay assignment (in class) (55%) :learning objectives 1, 2, and 4\nEnd terms BA MKDA: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12"", ""Literature\ncourse literature to be announced in Canvas"", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nBA2 students Geschiedenis variant History & Heritage;\nBA 2 students History and International Studies; BA2 and BA3 MKDA students;\nInternational humanities students, level 200-300."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nFor international exchange students a basic knowledge of (art or architectural) history or heritage studies. is required (on level 200-300).""]"

What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source.

Cuneiform tablets survive not only from Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) but also from Syria, Turkey and Egypt and they tell us about all imaginable aspects of human life in ancient times: how cities and states were organized, how great battles were fought and won, which laws governed societies, people's beliefs about gods and even what kind of songs they listened to or how they cooked their meals.

In Western culture, the rebirth of Classical culture was proudly claimed by all who sought to establish their authority or legitimize power, from the Carolingian Empire to papal Rome, and from the Ancien Régime to the Third Reich. In this module, we will follow two tracks simultaneously. On the one hand, the cultural history of the West will be thematized on the basis of standard periodization, which ranges from Late Antiquity to Modernism and Postmodernism. How has the Classical heritage been tended, interpreted, appropriated or rejected through the centuries? On the other hand, a number of thematic sessions will explore specific topics from a diachronic perspective. In general, these will be discussed using a case study in which various elements play a role: texts as well as material sources (e.g. visual art, architecture).

There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past.

So how can we know anything about this intriguing world? How do new and changed insights about Antiquity come about? In other words: how does research into the past work? The first-year module ‘Historical sources’ introduces all students of Classical philology, Archaeology and Ancient Studies to the process of research into the past, with a particular focus on the role of sources. For all knowledge of the past starts from the analysis of primary sources: relics of the past, whether surviving by accident or carefully transmitted.\nAt the end of this module, students are able to:\nidentify and execute the consecutive steps of the process of research into the past\nidentify various types of primary sources from the Ancient World, using the appropriate academic terms\ndiscuss the typical features, potential and limitations of the types of historical sources studied in class\napply source criticism to historical sources\nassess the value of different types of primary sources for different research questions, and to explain the advantages of combining multiple types of sources (multi-disciplinarity)"", ""Course Content\nIn this module, students are introduced to the whole spectrum of primary sources, the ways these have reached us, and the consequences of this process of survival for their potential and validity. The focus will lay on textual and iconographic sources from Classical Antiquity, such as historiographical texts, inscriptions, documents on papyrus and coins. What are their special features? What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source. Various sources can complement and enrich our picture of the past, as will be shown throughout the module by means of interesting and interdisciplinary case studies.

In every period and every region cities had specific traits, but they all share some basic characteristics. Evaluating these differences and similarities is an important goal of this course. What does a provincial Roman town share with a medieval or a Viking town? As archaeologists we are especially interested in the physical remains of urban settlements in the past, varying from palaces and temples or churches to urban housing of the poor or the activities of craftsmen. We will look at some phenomena recurring in all cities of pre-industrial societies.

So how can we know anything about this intriguing world? How do new and changed insights about Antiquity come about? In other words: how does research into the past work? The first-year module ‘Historical sources’ introduces all students of Classical philology, Archaeology and Ancient Studies to the process of research into the past, with a particular focus on the role of sources. For all knowledge of the past starts from the analysis of primary sources: relics of the past, whether surviving by accident or carefully transmitted.\nAt the end of this module, students are able to:\nidentify and execute the consecutive steps of the process of research into the past\nidentify various types of primary sources from the Ancient World, using the appropriate academic terms\ndiscuss the typical features, potential and limitations of the types of historical sources studied in class\napply source criticism to historical sources\nassess the value of different types of primary sources for different research questions, and to explain the advantages of combining multiple types of sources (multi-disciplinarity)"", ""Course Content\nIn this module, students are introduced to the whole spectrum of primary sources, the ways these have reached us, and the consequences of this process of survival for their potential and validity. The focus will lay on textual and iconographic sources from Classical Antiquity, such as historiographical texts, inscriptions, documents on papyrus and coins. What are their special features? What are their potential and limitations for research? We will not only look at texts and images, but also at the material forms in which they have reached us. You will learn to use these sources for research purposes: how to evaluate them critically and to analyze them so as to answer a specific research question.\nEach source type requires specific analytical skills. These often represent a subdiscipline within the wider field of ancient studies. For most research questions it is essential, however, to use more than just one type of source. Various sources can complement and enrich our picture of the past, as will be shown throughout the module by means of interesting and interdisciplinary case studies. When visiting the historical location of one of these cases, you even will personally experience the added value of such an interdisciplinary approach."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nThis course consists of lectures, seminars and group projects."", ""Method of Assessment\nParticipation: assignments in preparation of and in class (not graded)\nWritten exam\nThe resit regulations regarding the assignments are specified in the study manual."", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nFirst-year ACASA students of Classics, Archaeology, and Ancient Studies.\nThe course is also open to elective students who have participated in A Cultural History of the Ancient World 1 and 2, or who can demonstrate to have attained a comparable level, for instance by completing specific parts of the BA History."", ""Additional Information\nThis course is part of a joined programme by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA).

During the discussion, a lawyer pointed out some legal issues and cautiously began, “I know you don’t want to hear this from a lawyer, but…” Before he could continue, another board member cut him off aggressively: “…then shut the f*** up.” This attitude was common among computer scientists as well. While developers and designers focused on what was possible, lawyers concentrated on what was permissible, often without attempting to understand the potential of the technology.\nToday, the situation is no longer black and white, but rather gray. Lawyers understand technology and development processes better, and AI specialists understand the need to comply with the law. Technology and the law are no longer systematically seen as adversaries. Against this backdrop, many governments around the world are launching initiatives to regulate AI. Their goal is often to contain high-risk AI while supporting other AI applications. One such example is the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act.\nThis course explores how AI is governed by legal rules and standards. By the end of the course, students will have a solid grasp of the EU AI Act, including the constraints it imposes on AI development and its key limitations. This will put them in a unique position to contribute to the development of legally compliant AI systems.

In modern computer networks, data communication takes place by sending data from A to B via a layered architecture where each layer implements a different abstraction. The higher layers are responsible for handling web pages, emails, and similar things, that are translated into packets, bits, and eventually digital signals on physical links (e.g., light pulses, electrical signals in copper wires, radio waves).\nThis layered architecture with increasing levels of abstraction and separation of concerns, is a fundamental approach that you will encounter in all aspects of computer science (and beyond). Within this architecture, we will concern ourselves with questions like: what route should the data follow through the network, what do we do when errors occur, how do we interconnect two networks that have completely different properties, etc.\nFollowing the IEEE/ACM Computer Science curriculum, topics to be discussed include the layered network architecture, different types of networks (e.g., wired and wireless, LAN and WAN), multiplexing, error control, flow control, routing and forwarding, names and addresses, high-level architectures of networked applications (peer-to-peer, client/server, etc), performance issues, and scalability issues.

Students will study the phases that children go through when acquiring their native speech, i.e. their first language (L1). By reading various book chapters, and articles, students will also explore different explanations for the fact that every healthy, or typically developing child, is able to master his or her L1 within a few years, solely based on the language input they are exposed to, and interaction with e.g., caregivers, but without any systematic instructions or feedback on language. This fact will be unraveled from both a generative and a usage-based perspective.\nFurthermore, students will also study the language acquisition processes of children with atypical language development. These children do not go through the same process as observed with typically developing children in their L1 acquisition. They may show a delay, or a distinct pattern. It is also possible that they do not fully acquire their L1 system. Sometimes there is a clear cause for an atypical development, such as hearing disabilities. However, it is not always the case to have a clear cause for atypicality in L1 development. One example here is children with a specific disorder for language learning, i.e. developmental language disorder. Students will therefore also study different types of disorders which one can diagnose before the age of 6 years old.\nThe course also includes several practicum sessions. Students will spend these sessions to learn how to analyze spontaneous production data by children – both typically and atypically developing – by either using a computer program (i.e. CLAN) or in a manual way.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned topics, students will also focus on how to transform knowledge - theoretical knowledge combined with child- specific knowledge - into advice and recommendations to parents and professionals (e.g. caretakers in child-care, teachers in special education).

Much of what people do, say, think, and prefer is influenced by culture. This relationship is evident in cultural stereotypes, pop culture, verbal communication, non-verbal communication, online discourse, and so on. Drawing inspirations from everyday examples, we will identify common communication patterns, which will be analysed based on prominent theories in cross-cultural communication and discourse analysis. We will explore a range of communication phenomena, addressing questions such as:\nIn what ways do members of different national cultures produce and interpret communicative acts differently, and why?\nIs communication gendered? How? Why?\nHow is non-verbal communication shaped by cultural norms?\nHow do communicative cultures emerge?\nThe examples we work with during the course may vary and students will be asked to collect data for their own small-scale research analyses.

Students will also be able to perform basic linguistic analyses on language datasets from languages they do not speak."", ""Course Content\nIn this course, we will study the basics of linguistics and applied linguistics. We start out with studying the language acquisition processes young children go through. We will focus on the developmental processes in sound, word and sentence acquisition. We will also pay some attention to language disorders, such as developmental disorders and aphasia. Taking language acquisition as a starting point, we will then study the systems for sound production, word formation and sentence construction as universal properties of languages. In our phonetics and phonology classes we will study how sounds are pronounced and perceived and how meaning is mapped onto sounds in different languages. We then move on to how words and sentences are formed in a number of languages and how this helps us categorize languages into families (topics: morphology and syntax). In the fourth week, we focus on how languages change from generation to generation and how language contact causes regional language change. In these first four weeks we will study language examples from English and Dutch but also from typologically completely different languages such as Austronesian languages and Amazonian languages. In week five, we will focus less on the language system itself and more on language use.

For instance, consumers post a negative review of their restaurant visit on Tripadvisor or post about their positive experience with an electronic device they recently ordered on Google. The process of electronic word of mouth amplifies these messages and can have consequences for companies' brand reputations.\nTo manage the potential negative impact of dissatisfied customer experiences, organizations have appointed organizational representatives to monitor the online interactions (i.e., who is talking with what sentiment(s) about our organization/products/services?). When deemed necessary, these representatives intervene by responding to questions, complaints, and compliments. Such practices have become known as webcare.\nRecently, webcare has become a topic of interest in scientific research. There have been numerous experimental studies in which the effects of specific webcare interventions are examined. But it is still unclear which determinants play a role in this process and which (psychological, linguistic, interpersonal) theoretical models can be related to the phenomenon.\nThis course teaches the theoretical principles related to online phenomena such as electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and webcare.

Examples of philosophical questions are: What is reality? What can human beings know? How do our academic frameworks steer our understanding? How does knowledge inform our practical life, and our morality?\nIn this course, we will focus on the intercultural aspects of philosophy, which center on the question of understanding. Human thinking is formed and rooted in cultures. These are not fixed, bounded wholes, but we are able to learn another culture from the inside by living in it, and can go back and forth through different cultures. How do we, however, translate between cultures? And how can we understand someone who is formed to think in another language, with different moral rules?\nDue to colonialism, often in philosophy, Eurocentric philosophical traditions are centered while other forms of philosophy are neglected. From the end of the 20th century, German and Austrian philosophers have formed a school of Intercultural Philosophy as a way to address this.

In this course, we will introduce you to the wealth of knowledge about persuasive communication accumulated over 2400 years of scholarly reflections on this topic. We will focus on the most prominent theories of persuasion from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and communication studies; for example, the cognitive dissonance theory, the theory of planned behaviour model and the elaboration likelihood model. We also pay special attention to the relationship between persuasion and (news and social) media, addressing such topics as the spread of mis- and disinformation. Together, we will discuss and analyse examples of persuasive communication in political settings, sales, advertising, news and social media. The course will also introduce you to the research methods used to study persuasive communication as well as encourage you to think critically about their respective strengths and limitations.

Examples of philosophical questions are: What is reality? What can human beings know? How do our academic frameworks steer our understanding? How does knowledge inform our practical life, and our morality?\nIn this course, we will focus on the intercultural aspects of philosophy, which center on the question of understanding. Human thinking is formed and rooted in cultures. These are not fixed, bounded wholes, but we are able to learn another culture from the inside by living in it, and can go back and forth through different cultures. How do we, however, translate between cultures? And how can we understand someone who is formed to think in another language, with different moral rules?\nDue to colonialism, often in philosophy, Eurocentric philosophical traditions are centered while other forms of philosophy are neglected. From the end of the 20th century, German and Austrian philosophers have formed a school of Intercultural Philosophy as a way to address this. You will get acquainted with their approach, and with further developments of their thought by other philosophers. Using the intercultural philosophy approach, you will zoom in on the question of ‘Self-hood’ by reflecting on philosophies from African and Asian cultures."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nEach week there are two lectures, and one seminar, for a total of 5.25 contact hours per week.

For instance, consumers post a negative review of their restaurant visit on Tripadvisor or post about their positive experience with an electronic device they recently ordered on Google.

When deemed necessary, these representatives intervene by responding to questions, complaints, and compliments. Such practices have become known as webcare.\nRecently, webcare has become a topic of interest in scientific research.

We know metaphor from literary texts, like Shakespeare’s sonnets (‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?), but metaphors are also crucial beyond literature. We use them as the major device to make sense of complex or abstract phenomena and to convey our everyday conceptual and emotional experiences. Most of us are unaware of the way our language system is filled with metaphorically used words (think about verbs and prepositions). At the same time, in many disciplines metaphor is used more deliberately for rhetorical or instructional purposes. For example, politicians talk about ‘going to war against’ the Corona epidemic; epidemiologists have framed it as a disaster (‘your house is on fire’) and its spread has been described as a ‘domino-effect’. Metaphorical language has the power to illuminate, but also to obscure a topic; it has the power to change the way we view the world.\nIn this course, we will explore the use of metaphorical language and the different functions it has (e.g. to transfer knowledge, to create identity, to frame and envisage other realities) in different professional settings, such as health care (and illnesses), the courtroom, or education.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship."", ""Course Content\nSBE HP students can choose to substitute their elective course for a high-quality RA, preferably in their third bachelor year. It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship."", ""Course Content\nSBE HP students can choose to substitute their elective course for a high-quality RA, preferably in their third bachelor year. It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project.

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application). In doing so, you practice skills such as abstraction and reasoning (Academic and Research Skills).\nAfter following this course you can:\ndescribe and explain the typical features of the regulatory framework of financial reporting in developed economies;\ndescribe common accounting practices for a selection of common transactions and events (e.g. income tax, currency translation, intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries) discussed in this course;\nfor the selected transactions and events: solve a given issue in the form of a motivated choice for a specific accounting treatment, journals entries and/or completed financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement);\nrecognize and explain in a given fragment from published financial statements how an item or transaction has been accounted for, or explain the reporting about such accounting in a news media item;\nuse and interpret selected regulatory texts to answer questions about mandatory or optional accounting and reporting practices."", ""Course Content\nExternal financial reporting in the form of annual or quarterly financial statements is the basis of communication between a company and financial stakeholders such as shareholders and other investors. Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets. However, they also have legal significance, and are important in corporate governance. For larger enterprises, preparing financial statements is a complex process.\nThis is not just because it is a challenge to properly represent the performance and economic position of complex businesses, but also because there are significant interests at stake. Financial reporting can go spectacularly wrong, as evidenced by major accounting scandals that happen from time to time. For that reason, an elaborate institutional framework of regulations and standards, audit, supervision and enforcement has been built up around the practice of financial reporting. This framework consists both of national elements (such as company law) and international elements (such as International Financial Reporting Standards).\nIn this course, you do not just develop your technical 'how' skills (e.g. preparing consolidated financial statements, or working out the effects of currency translation on reported numbers) but you also train yourself to ask the 'why' question. Why does it matter to this company to account for this transaction in this way? Is there a rule that must be followed? Or does it have a choice? Who decides? Why is the rule the way it is? Could it be improved?\nNot everybody finds it easy to switch between accounting technique and the wider context of standards, governance and economic interests in which this technique is applied, but it is an essential skill for everybody who works in a professional way with financial reporting, whether as controller, auditor, financial analyst, manager, investor, or supervisor. The fact that accounting always plays out in this wider context is what makes financial reporting a fascinating discipline with a unique character."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures and tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam (individual assessment), optional interim exam (individual assessment)"", ""Literature\nTextbook: Aerts, W. and P.

The course addresses the general (competitive) equilibrium. This includes a discussion of the concept of Pareto efficiency and the conditions under which efficiency can be reached. In this context social welfare is considered. The concept of Pareto efficiency is being compared to the concept of \""fair\"" allocation. Externalities and public goods are reasons for missing markets and may cause Pareto efficiency to be violated. Monopoly is a market structure that leads to absence of Pareto efficiency in the equilibrium. Causes of monopoly, such as the natural monopoly, are considered. Monopolists can use their power to conduct specific pricing strategies such as price discrimination. A market structure in between competition and monopoly is monopolistic competition. Firms in such markets have market power, but free entry drives profits to zero in the long run. In oligopolistic markets strategic interactions play an important role. Examples of such interactions are the decision to cooperate or not, and to deter entry or not. Game-theoretic methods provide insight in various aspects of the strategies. With the rise of information technology new structures emerged by which suppliers offer their products. Some specific issues in these new markets are discussed. An auction is an allocation mechanism with various applications, among which is the auctioning of radio frequencies. In auctions strategy game-theoretic aspects play a role as well. Information is a very important aspect in the functioning of markets. Information asymmetry can lead to market failure, but also induce agents to find mechanisms to signal information and to find incentive payment schemes that function even if information is incomplete.

Accordingly, it is crucial for many companies to successfully manage their activities at an international or global scale. However, in most cases, home country practices cannot be simply “spilled over” to foreign markets. On top of that, companies operating across borders continuously face global challenges that persist or newly emerge.\nThe objective of this course is thus not only to familiarize students with and give an overview of the unique characteristics and peculiarities of the “international side of management”, also and especially from a functional perspective. The course is also intended for students to develop the ability to propose recommendations for internationally or globally active companies (and their functions) in the face of (global) megatrends. CIIM aims to develop students’ team-working and professional communication skills and enables them to think beyond the borders of the individual organization/company.\nThis course contributes to the SBE's Bridging Theory and Practice overall learning goal.

In a world where change is constant—from digital disruption and economic shifts to climate urgency—organizations must continuously adapt, often with the help of consultants.

The theory and practice of the startup will also be covered. Aspects of growth and development of small business to larger business will be covered such as planning, organizing, strategizing and leading small organizations.

The influence of marketing in organizations and boardrooms seems to be fading. Marketeers and marketing researchers feel the need to show that marketing is not just spending dollars on advertising and CRM technology and social media departments without knowing whether these investments pay off.\nThis course aims to provide a comprehensive view on what it means to create value through marketing and how marketing’s value to customers, firms, shareholders, and other stakeholders is measured. Knowledge of marketing as dealt with in the subjects Marketing I and II is further deepened and related to other subjects (including Finance). The main premise is that marketing, although often associated with customer value only, has recently moved beyond the confines of customer orientation and towards a more holistic stakeholder orientation. It is this stakeholder view we work towards, touching upon different forms of creating value for these external entities as well as for the organization itself.\nYou will be actively encouraged to apply scientific knowledge in practice and to evaluate the practice on the basis of scientific insights (Bridging Theory and Practice - Knowledge). To this end, you will learn to apply quantitative instruments that provide insight into the financial effects of choices in the process of value creation (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application) and to read academic papers comprehensively and derive their practical implications (Academic and Research Skills). You will learn how organizations interpret value creation processes and how they relate to the social context (Broadening your Horizon). Furthermore, you will work together as a team and present your insights regularly to your peers, stimulating discussions and feedback (Professional Social Skills)."", ""Course Content\nHow can marketing be valuable? This is the main question guiding our perspective on value-based marketing. In this respect, we go beyond a narrow definition of the term value-based marketing, which often focuses on questions surrounding the marketing-finance interface (“How does marketing create shareholder value?”, “How can marketing activities’ financial value be made explicit?”).\nBy contrast, we take a holistic view on the term “value-based”, linking it to customers (consumers, companies), shareholders, partners, society – in short, numerous stakeholders that might be affected by marketing’s value creation and appropriation process. This so-called stakeholder orientation on marketing is relatively new and is trying to understand marketing’s impact and responsibility beyond its traditional scope.\nUnfortunately, marketing is all too often misunderstood and used to achieve results in the short term or to pursue self-interests. In this course, we will see that this one-sided view on marketing is narrow-minded and often counterproductive. Marketing can be especially valuable for all parties involved if they understand how long-term value can be created (value creation) FOR the customers and appropriated (value appropriation) from the customers to serve different stakeholders. To this end, we study relevant theories and concepts as well as the implementation of value-based marketing in practice.\nYou will study relevant theories and concepts and get acquainted with the implementation of value-based marketing in practice.

At the heart of this fascination is the idea of a network: the architecture of interconnections. This aspect permeates our social and economic lives in countless ways. Social networks play a central role in the transmission of information, how we vote, how diseases spread, whether we become criminals, what products we buy, which education we choose, and it highly impacts the likelihood of succeeding professionally. Furthermore, agents build their business relationships and networks anticipating the outcomes that result from this interaction. Network aspects also explain why many economic environments of interest are dominated by a few agents, be individuals or firms. Think for example of scientists competing for publicizing their work, pharma firms engaging in R&D for the development of new drugs, or online travel agents trying to attract hotels and travelers to their websites. The choices of these interconnected agents have far-reaching effects not only on prices, quantities, and the direction of innovation, and may cause wide repercussions throughout the economy.\nThe course begins with an empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of the concepts used to describe and measure networks. Next, we cover a set of models about how networks form, including random network models, as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrid models. We then move to a discussion of a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including opinion formation, disease, contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.\nNext, keeping an eye on the current pressing problems in business and society, the course centers around strategic behavior in markets and networks, both from the business perspective as well as from the societal viewpoint. We will discuss competition in the presence of network externalities, market power and abuse of dominant position, the formation of R&D collaboration alliances, the impact of cross-ownership on the intensity and the direction of innovation, information frictions in consumer and labor markets, consumer search, advertising models and search engine sponsored ad auctions.\nThis course fits in the VU profile themes ‘Governance for Society’, ‘Connected World’, and ‘Science for Sustainability’."", ""Course Content\nPart 1: Social and Economic Networks (Ines Lindner)\n1.

Moreover, companies are increasingly adopting a business logic based on co-creating value propositions with customers.\nMarketing, as a function that is closest to the consumer, plays a key role in giving shape to this new era in business management. With today’s consumers continuously connected online, it is imperative for marketing managers to understand and evaluate the customer journey online in order to fully understand the impact of their marketing activities and plan successful new digital marketing strategies.

Examples include bank lending, college admissions, and bail decisions in criminal proceedings.\nThough the use of algorithmic decision making is often justified as being \""more objective\"" than human decision making, there are many instances demonstrating that it can produce biased or discriminatory predictions or decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain individuals or groups. Awareness of this issue and knowledge about approaches to address it are of high importance for data scientists and policy makers.\nAnother highly relevant aspect for decision making based on data is the interpretability of the estimation outcomes and decisions obtained using a machine learning method. One possibility is to restrict the class of applied algorithms to interpretable models (e.g. decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression). However, \""black-box\"" methods (e.g. random forests, deep neural networks) have proven to be highly effective in many more complex settings, while not providing a means to understand the sources of a particular prediction or decision. Model-agnostic methods such as partial dependence plots, Local Surrogate models (LIME), and Shapley Values are important concepts enhancing interpretability and allowing for comparisons of any set of machine learning outcomes.\nThe course is divided into two parts.

One possibility is to restrict the class of applied algorithms to interpretable models (e.g. decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression). However, \""black-box\"" methods (e.g. random forests, deep neural networks) have proven to be highly effective in many more complex settings, while not providing a means to understand the sources of a particular prediction or decision. Model-agnostic methods such as partial dependence plots, Local Surrogate models (LIME), and Shapley Values are important concepts enhancing interpretability and allowing for comparisons of any set of machine learning outcomes.\nThe course is divided into two parts. The first part of the course (weeks 1-3) addresses the topic of interpretability in supervised machine learning settings. We will study local and global methods to interpret the outcomes of black-box models and apply them to a range of real-world examples. The second part (weeks 4-6) is concerned with fairness in machine learning. We will introduce formal definitions of fairness, analyze real-world data sets, and discuss what algorithmic decision making can and cannot achieve."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\n4 hours per week of lectures, 2 hours per week of tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam, group assignment."", ""Entry Requirements\nKnowledge of probability theory, statistics, regression analysis, programming in Python.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship."", ""Course Content\nSBE HP students can choose to substitute their elective course for a high-quality RA, preferably in their third bachelor year. It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program. Entry level requirement may also be set for specific projects, which require certain quantitative or qualitative research skills. Typically, the second half of the last year in the honours programme may fit best when combining this with the BSc thesis.\nStudents engaging in an RA are required to notify the programme coordinator up-front, and send a project proposal for approval to honoursprogramma.sbe@vu.nl.\nThis proposal, developed jointly with the prospective supervisor, should include:\n1.

This course elaborates on the costs and benefits of globalization introducing modern non-mainstream theories that at points challenge the traditional wisdom regarding the benefits of globalization and helps to understand the prevailing sentiments against globalization. We will heavily rely on insights from transaction cost theory which challenges the neglect in traditional neoclassical theory of transaction costs. The (oftentimes implicit) reliance in mainstream trade theory on frictionless trade is surprising for theories in which exchange is at the heart of the matter. This course aims to familiarize you with the concept of transaction costs and to show the relevance of transaction costs for understanding several of the empirical phenomena that are impossible to understand without relying on such costs.\nInsights are particularly relevant to appreciate current discussions on the impact of globalization on a small open economy such as the Netherlands. Think, for example, about recent discussions on reshoring and the impact of globalization on wage inequality and unemployment. The course will focus on four main areas of research in which transaction costs are dominant, viz. (i) international trade with a focus on the multiple dimensions of transaction costs distinguishing between transport costs, institutional costs and cultural costs of exchange, (ii) foreign direct investments with a focus on outsourcing and the organization of the firm in a globalizing world, (iii) industrial organization with a focus on the determinants of the boundaries of the firm, and (iv) networks with a focus on the role of social and regional networks, and on standards as institutionalized settings that facilitate exchange of goods, ideas, etc."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nInteractive lectures."", ""Method of Assessment\nIndividual paper and presentation, and optional assignments."", ""Literature\nAn extensive reading list is made available at the start of the course."", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nSecond and third year participants in the honours program."", ""Custom Course Registration\nSBE rules and dates apply for this SBE HP course."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nBasic familiarity with the principles of economics and statistics.""]"

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application).

Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets. However, they also have legal significance, and are important in corporate governance. For larger enterprises, preparing financial statements is a complex process.\nThis is not just because it is a challenge to properly represent the performance and economic position of complex businesses, but also because there are significant interests at stake. Financial reporting can go spectacularly wrong, as evidenced by major accounting scandals that happen from time to time. For that reason, an elaborate institutional framework of regulations and standards, audit, supervision and enforcement has been built up around the practice of financial reporting. This framework consists both of national elements (such as company law) and international elements (such as International Financial Reporting Standards).\nIn this course, you do not just develop your technical 'how' skills (e.g. preparing consolidated financial statements, or working out the effects of currency translation on reported numbers) but you also train yourself to ask the 'why' question. Why does it matter to this company to account for this transaction in this way? Is there a rule that must be followed? Or does it have a choice? Who decides? Why is the rule the way it is? Could it be improved?\nNot everybody finds it easy to switch between accounting technique and the wider context of standards, governance and economic interests in which this technique is applied, but it is an essential skill for everybody who works in a professional way with financial reporting, whether as controller, auditor, financial analyst, manager, investor, or supervisor. The fact that accounting always plays out in this wider context is what makes financial reporting a fascinating discipline with a unique character."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures and tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam (individual assessment), optional interim exam (individual assessment)"", ""Literature\nTextbook: Aerts, W. and P.

The course addresses the general (competitive) equilibrium. This includes a discussion of the concept of Pareto efficiency and the conditions under which efficiency can be reached. In this context social welfare is considered. The concept of Pareto efficiency is being compared to the concept of \""fair\"" allocation. Externalities and public goods are reasons for missing markets and may cause Pareto efficiency to be violated. Monopoly is a market structure that leads to absence of Pareto efficiency in the equilibrium. Causes of monopoly, such as the natural monopoly, are considered. Monopolists can use their power to conduct specific pricing strategies such as price discrimination. A market structure in between competition and monopoly is monopolistic competition. Firms in such markets have market power, but free entry drives profits to zero in the long run. In oligopolistic markets strategic interactions play an important role. Examples of such interactions are the decision to cooperate or not, and to deter entry or not. Game-theoretic methods provide insight in various aspects of the strategies. With the rise of information technology new structures emerged by which suppliers offer their products. Some specific issues in these new markets are discussed. An auction is an allocation mechanism with various applications, among which is the auctioning of radio frequencies. In auctions strategy game-theoretic aspects play a role as well. Information is a very important aspect in the functioning of markets. Information asymmetry can lead to market failure, but also induce agents to find mechanisms to signal information and to find incentive payment schemes that function even if information is incomplete. The concept of revealed preference will be explained during the course."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures. Instruction tutorials.

Accordingly, it is crucial for many companies to successfully manage their activities at an international or global scale. However, in most cases, home country practices cannot be simply “spilled over” to foreign markets. On top of that, companies operating across borders continuously face global challenges that persist or newly emerge.\nThe objective of this course is thus not only to familiarize students with and give an overview of the unique characteristics and peculiarities of the “international side of management”, also and especially from a functional perspective. The course is also intended for students to develop the ability to propose recommendations for internationally or globally active companies (and their functions) in the face of (global) megatrends. CIIM aims to develop students’ team-working and professional communication skills and enables them to think beyond the borders of the individual organization/company.\nThis course contributes to the SBE's Bridging Theory and Practice overall learning goal. After completing the course, students should:\nHave thorough knowledge of relevant theory and methods in the context of International Management, and an evidence-based approach to solving complex international/global business problems; in other words, students show knowledge of fundamental International Management theory and are able to use theory to solve complex practical problems of managing in international contexts.\nHave the professional and social skills to interact with other professionals; students should be able to express their solutions to practical problems verbally and in writing."", ""Course Content\nThe lectures start with a general introduction of International Management, its development and definitory remarks. Afterwards, International Strategy is introduced as an overarching, cross-functional phenomenon that profoundly influences International Management. The majority of lectures is devoted to the International Management of a company’s functions, particularly marketing, finance, operations and human resources. Differences between domestically-oriented functions and internationally/globally oriented functions will be highlighted. Based on this, it will be discussed how international company functions can be managed successfully in today’s world.\nThe tutorials will give students the opportunity to discuss and receive feedback on their podcast projects, in which they link contemporary megatrends with the International Management of (a) specific company function(s) with the help of theoretical/conceptual frameworks and expert input.

The influence of marketing in organizations and boardrooms seems to be fading. Marketeers and marketing researchers feel the need to show that marketing is not just spending dollars on advertising and CRM technology and social media departments without knowing whether these investments pay off.\nThis course aims to provide a comprehensive view on what it means to create value through marketing and how marketing’s value to customers, firms, shareholders, and other stakeholders is measured. Knowledge of marketing as dealt with in the subjects Marketing I and II is further deepened and related to other subjects (including Finance). The main premise is that marketing, although often associated with customer value only, has recently moved beyond the confines of customer orientation and towards a more holistic stakeholder orientation. It is this stakeholder view we work towards, touching upon different forms of creating value for these external entities as well as for the organization itself.\nYou will be actively encouraged to apply scientific knowledge in practice and to evaluate the practice on the basis of scientific insights (Bridging Theory and Practice - Knowledge). To this end, you will learn to apply quantitative instruments that provide insight into the financial effects of choices in the process of value creation (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application) and to read academic papers comprehensively and derive their practical implications (Academic and Research Skills). You will learn how organizations interpret value creation processes and how they relate to the social context (Broadening your Horizon). Furthermore, you will work together as a team and present your insights regularly to your peers, stimulating discussions and feedback (Professional Social Skills)."", ""Course Content\nHow can marketing be valuable? This is the main question guiding our perspective on value-based marketing. In this respect, we go beyond a narrow definition of the term value-based marketing, which often focuses on questions surrounding the marketing-finance interface (“How does marketing create shareholder value?”, “How can marketing activities’ financial value be made explicit?”).\nBy contrast, we take a holistic view on the term “value-based”, linking it to customers (consumers, companies), shareholders, partners, society – in short, numerous stakeholders that might be affected by marketing’s value creation and appropriation process. This so-called stakeholder orientation on marketing is relatively new and is trying to understand marketing’s impact and responsibility beyond its traditional scope.\nUnfortunately, marketing is all too often misunderstood and used to achieve results in the short term or to pursue self-interests. In this course, we will see that this one-sided view on marketing is narrow-minded and often counterproductive. Marketing can be especially valuable for all parties involved if they understand how long-term value can be created (value creation) FOR the customers and appropriated (value appropriation) from the customers to serve different stakeholders. To this end, we study relevant theories and concepts as well as the implementation of value-based marketing in practice.\nYou will study relevant theories and concepts and get acquainted with the implementation of value-based marketing in practice.

The course addresses the general (competitive) equilibrium. This includes a discussion of the concept of Pareto efficiency and the conditions under which efficiency can be reached. In this context social welfare is considered. The concept of Pareto efficiency is being compared to the concept of \""fair\"" allocation. Externalities and public goods are reasons for missing markets and may cause Pareto efficiency to be violated. Monopoly is a market structure that leads to absence of Pareto efficiency in the equilibrium. Causes of monopoly, such as the natural monopoly, are considered. Monopolists can use their power to conduct specific pricing strategies such as price discrimination. A market structure in between competition and monopoly is monopolistic competition. Firms in such markets have market power, but free entry drives profits to zero in the long run. In oligopolistic markets strategic interactions play an important role. Examples of such interactions are the decision to cooperate or not, and to deter entry or not. Game-theoretic methods provide insight in various aspects of the strategies. With the rise of information technology new structures emerged by which suppliers offer their products. Some specific issues in these new markets are discussed. An auction is an allocation mechanism with various applications, among which is the auctioning of radio frequencies. In auctions strategy game-theoretic aspects play a role as well. Information is a very important aspect in the functioning of markets. Information asymmetry can lead to market failure, but also induce agents to find mechanisms to signal information and to find incentive payment schemes that function even if information is incomplete.

The government insures risks of unemployment, sickness, disability and old age. The government provides infrastructure such as roads, trains and dykes. The government corrects market failures and aims to internalize externalities, such as with the environment. And the government uses spending, taxes and debt to stabilize the business cycle.

This also includes mathematical models and methods for empirically estimating the economic values of non-priced goods such as carbon emissions and time, and methods to judge the value of investment projects through, in particular, cost-benefit analysis.\nAfter completing this course:\nAcademic and Research Skills\nYou can critically analyse the functioning and failure of markets and develop government policies to combat market failures.\nBridging Theory and Practice – Knowledge\nYou are able to explain how externalities can be \""internalized\"" through Pigouvian taxation and tradable permits, both in first-best and second-best situations.\nYou are able to describe the causes and consequences of tax competition between governments and of market power in networks and to provide policy advice to combat this.\nYou are able to characterize the extraction path of natural resources in a market equilibrium and you are able to explain why and how this path differs from the socially optimal one.\nBridging Theory and Practice - Application\nYou can apply economic methods and techniques to analyse market failures and evaluate associated policies.\nYou are able to make cost-benefit calculations and you can use valuation methods (such as discrete choice models and stated\npreferences).\nSocial Professional Skills\nYou are able to present and discuss results from scientific articles in a comprehensible manner, both written and orally, together with and in front of your fellow students.\nBroadening your Horizon\nYou are aware of the various difficulties that may arise in regulating markets in reality, and you understand that simple \""recipes\"", while useful to illustrate the possibilities, cannot simply be applied in practice."", ""Course Content\nThe premise that the free market automatically leads to an efficient allocation of goods and factors of production, and that, as a result, the government should not intervene in the market process, is often too simple a representation of reality. This course deals with the complex relationship between \""market\"" and \""government\"" from the perspective of environmental and transport economics. In the course, general economic insights with regard to the relationship between \""market\"" and \""government\"" are developed and elaborated on the basis of practical and appealing examples.\nAt the core of the course is the concept of \""externalities\"" as an economic cause of environmental problems such as pollution and overexploitation of natural resources. Policy instruments to combat these problems are discussed in the course. In addition, other forms of externalities are being investigated - in particular traffic jams and congestion in road traffic. But the course also deals with market failures arising from market power on the railways (\""natural monopoly\""), in aviation (\""oligopoly\"" and contestable markets\"") and in energy supply (\""cartels\"" such as OPEC); or because of public goods such as infrastructure. Finally, methods to empirically estimate the economic values of non-priced goods such as carbon emissions and time, and methods to make informed investment decisions (in particular cost-benefit analysis) are discussed and applied."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures.\nInstruction lectures.\nTutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam - individual assessment.\nAssignments - group assessment."", ""Literature\n- Transport Economics: Syllabus \""Markets and Governments: Transport Economic Applications\"".\n- Environmental Economics: Perman, P., Y.

That is why this course is an absolute must for people who want to understand the role of the financial system in a modern economy. The current system is first discussed, with attention being paid to the role of both the central bank and the commercial banks. The money creation process is central here. Alternatives to the current system are also discussed. Among other things, it examines so-called full reserve banking promoted in the 1930s by, among others, Irving Fisher and Friedrich Hayek’s proposal for the Denationalization of money. We also consider Silvio Gesell’s Schwundgeld. Moreover, we will dig deeply into new developments, such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currency.\nCentral to all this is the question of what society can expect from a financial system, the role of prices in the decisions of producers and consumers and the importance of financial stability. It is explained why a modern economy cannot function without money and why an interest-free financial system is a difficult matter.\nBanks are by definition risky. This course therefore covers, among other things, the tasks of banks, the resulting risks and recent developments in bank supervision. Monetary policy, which is the central bank's policy that aims at price stability, is of course also part of the material. Special attention is given to the most current developments, such as the policy of quantitative easing and the recent spike in inflation and its background. Concepts such as monetary financing (\""turning on the money press\""), the so-called \""helicopter money\"" and the so-called Modern Monetary Theory are discussed and stripped of their magical connotation. We then deal with the international monetary system. That starts with a thorough discussion of \""the exchange rate\"", in several forms, its importance for a country's monetary stability and competitive position and the forces that determine the value of an exchange rate. We also discuss the real effective exchange rate, explaining how countries within a single monetary union and, as in the case of EMU, the fact that countries that share a single currency can still have different real exchange rates. The advantages and disadvantages of a monetary union and of other exchange rate regimes are also discussed, in the context of the theory of the optimal currency areas.\nWe also discuss historical systems, such as the Golden Standard and the Bretton Woods System. Naturally, attention is paid to the most important international financial institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB). Understanding these older systems is necessary to understand the current dollar standard.\nWhen dealing with monetary developments over the past decades, we also briefly discuss the balance of payments, the relationship between the balance of payments and the international investment position of countries and the influence that international capital movements can have on the development of the money supply.\nWe also briefly discuss the subject of financial crises, with a focus on the most recent crises, viz. the Subprime crisis (2007/8) and the crisis in the euro zone (2010 with aftermath to this day). We pay special attention to developments in the eurozone or EMU. In addition, the EMU is tested against the criteria for a so-called optimum currency area. We also discuss the consequences of a possible (partial) break-up of EMU for the member states."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars, tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam.\nTutorials."", ""Literature\nSelected chapters from \""The Basics of Money and Banking.

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application). In doing so, you practice skills such as abstraction and reasoning (Academic and Research Skills).\nAfter following this course you can:\ndescribe and explain the typical features of the regulatory framework of financial reporting in developed economies;\ndescribe common accounting practices for a selection of common transactions and events (e.g. income tax, currency translation, intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries) discussed in this course;\nfor the selected transactions and events: solve a given issue in the form of a motivated choice for a specific accounting treatment, journals entries and/or completed financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement);\nrecognize and explain in a given fragment from published financial statements how an item or transaction has been accounted for, or explain the reporting about such accounting in a news media item;\nuse and interpret selected regulatory texts to answer questions about mandatory or optional accounting and reporting practices."", ""Course Content\nExternal financial reporting in the form of annual or quarterly financial statements is the basis of communication between a company and financial stakeholders such as shareholders and other investors. Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets. However, they also have legal significance, and are important in corporate governance. For larger enterprises, preparing financial statements is a complex process.\nThis is not just because it is a challenge to properly represent the performance and economic position of complex businesses, but also because there are significant interests at stake. Financial reporting can go spectacularly wrong, as evidenced by major accounting scandals that happen from time to time. For that reason, an elaborate institutional framework of regulations and standards, audit, supervision and enforcement has been built up around the practice of financial reporting. This framework consists both of national elements (such as company law) and international elements (such as International Financial Reporting Standards).\nIn this course, you do not just develop your technical 'how' skills (e.g. preparing consolidated financial statements, or working out the effects of currency translation on reported numbers) but you also train yourself to ask the 'why' question. Why does it matter to this company to account for this transaction in this way? Is there a rule that must be followed? Or does it have a choice? Who decides? Why is the rule the way it is? Could it be improved?\nNot everybody finds it easy to switch between accounting technique and the wider context of standards, governance and economic interests in which this technique is applied, but it is an essential skill for everybody who works in a professional way with financial reporting, whether as controller, auditor, financial analyst, manager, investor, or supervisor. The fact that accounting always plays out in this wider context is what makes financial reporting a fascinating discipline with a unique character."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures and tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam (individual assessment), optional interim exam (individual assessment)"", ""Literature\nTextbook: Aerts, W. and P.

Significant attention will be devoted to ethical threats facing the auditor (Self-Awareness, Broadening your Horizon).

The auditor has an important societal function because financial statement users (e.g., shareholders) and other stakeholders require some level of third-party assurance on the qualitative aspects of information found in the financial statements, such as information reliability and relevance. For example, shareholders require primarily assurance about the reliability of financial statements, since they use these statements for their professional decision-making. Providers of debt financing, such as banks, need to know whether the presented liquidity ratios are accurate.\nThe course will focus on the role of the auditor in society and what demands this role imposes on the auditor. We start by giving an introduction to the economic demand for auditing and the ethical requirements placed on the auditor by society and regulators. Next, the course focuses on the audit process, starting with the planning stage of the audit, where the auditor obtains an understanding of the client and its business and designs the audit plan, while paying careful attention to the audit risk model. The next two audit stages discussed at a general level include the conduct of audit procedures. Auditors can obtain various types of audit evidence to test the assertions (claims) made by management in the financial statements. The audit process concludes with the completion stage of the audit. By examining audit evidence obtained during an audit, auditors ultimately decide which type of auditor’s report to issue. We devote significant attention throughout the course on the audit profession’s need for ethical behavior and professional skepticism, as well as the auditor’s role and responsibilities with respect to fraud. Throughout the course, students will be offered the opportunity of interacting with practice during various case studies and guided discussions with lecturers with ample experience from audit practice.\nAside from offering students a practice-based introduction to the auditing profession, students will finally be exposed to the academic side of auditing by reading a selection of academic papers and discussing the importance of the findings for the auditing profession."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nPlenary lectures\nSmaller group tutorials"", ""Method of Assessment\nMidterm multiple choice test – individual assessment\nWeekly case assignments – group assessment\nCase presentation/discussion – group assessment\nWritten exam – individual assessment"", ""Literature\nHayes, R., Wallage, P., and P.

These inequalities may be associated with differences in the education level of individuals, discriminatory forces, changes in the demand for jobs (\""robotization\"") and health differences. For policymakers, a pertaining question is therefore on the use and usefulness of public investments in education and health, as well as regulatory measures to create a level playing field. This concerns both the theoretical arguments for policy interventions and the evidence on their effectiveness.\nThis course will address the origins of these socio-economic inequalities, using theories and empirical findings from the literature. Amongst others, questions that are addressed are on the returns to education (for individuals and society at large), the consequences of robotization, skill-biased technological change, discrimination at the labour market and how nature and nurture affect the health of individuals.\nHuman capital can be viewed as capital derived from investments in education and health. Both factors determine the returns on the labour market (work outcomes, income and wealth), and in general individual well-being. The joint distribution of education, work, income and health evolves across the life cycles of individuals as they grow from childhood, where they make educational choices, to adolescence and when they enter the labour market till prime ages and later when they enter the phase from working age into retirement. The resulting differences in educational achievement and labour market and health outcomes may lead to persistent and substantial socio-economic disparities.\nThroughout this course, theories are confronted with empirical papers that test these theories and their consequences for public policy in the area of education, income, health and work.

We consume food, drinks, education, and television programs. It is however not always easy to understand or predict the behavior of consumers. Why do consumers choose one car or holiday destination over the other? How are advertisements processed and when are they effective? Are preferences stable or easily malleable? For successful marketing management and strategy, it is essential to get an understanding of the behavior of consumers. After all, marketing begins and ends with the consumer, from determining consumer needs to finally providing and maintaining consumer satisfaction. The course introduces you to some important psychological theories on memory, learning, perception, attitude, motivation, identity and social influences. We do not only focus on “big theories”, but also study specific articles from top-notch journals in the field, thereby illustrating how research in this field is done, how this contributes to our knowledge on consumer decisions as well as to develop critical thinking.\nIn addition to the conceptual part of the course, considerable attention is allocated to (experimental) research methodology.

The intense use of digital media, the widespread adoption of smartphones, or the rise of digital platforms, they have all revolutionized the practice of marketing. More than ever before, online word-of-mouth and social media are considered important market forces that influence consumer decision-making all along the purchase process. Moreover, companies are increasingly adopting a business logic based on co-creating value propositions with customers.\nMarketing, as a function that is closest to the consumer, plays a key role in giving shape to this new era in business management. With today’s consumers continuously connected online, it is imperative for marketing managers to understand and evaluate the customer journey online in order to fully understand the impact of their marketing activities and plan successful new digital marketing strategies. However, in the era of big data, managers often do not know which metrics to focus on and how to extract valuable information from the data at hand.\nThe course examines digital marketing activities through the lens of customer journeys, focusing on three key moments: (1) Pre-purchase; (2) Purchase; (3) Post-purchase. For each moment, you will identify which factors play a bigger role in influencing consumers’ attitude and behaviour, based on the literature and your own analyses.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship."", ""Course Content\nSBE HP students can choose to substitute their elective course for a high-quality RA, preferably in their third bachelor year. It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program. Entry level requirement may also be set for specific projects, which require certain quantitative or qualitative research skills. Typically, the second half of the last year in the honours programme may fit best when combining this with the BSc thesis.\nStudents engaging in an RA are required to notify the programme coordinator up-front, and send a project proposal for approval to honoursprogramma.sbe@vu.nl.\nThis proposal, developed jointly with the prospective supervisor, should include:\n1.

This course elaborates on the costs and benefits of globalization introducing modern non-mainstream theories that at points challenge the traditional wisdom regarding the benefits of globalization and helps to understand the prevailing sentiments against globalization. We will heavily rely on insights from transaction cost theory which challenges the neglect in traditional neoclassical theory of transaction costs. The (oftentimes implicit) reliance in mainstream trade theory on frictionless trade is surprising for theories in which exchange is at the heart of the matter. This course aims to familiarize you with the concept of transaction costs and to show the relevance of transaction costs for understanding several of the empirical phenomena that are impossible to understand without relying on such costs.\nInsights are particularly relevant to appreciate current discussions on the impact of globalization on a small open economy such as the Netherlands. Think, for example, about recent discussions on reshoring and the impact of globalization on wage inequality and unemployment. The course will focus on four main areas of research in which transaction costs are dominant, viz. (i) international trade with a focus on the multiple dimensions of transaction costs distinguishing between transport costs, institutional costs and cultural costs of exchange, (ii) foreign direct investments with a focus on outsourcing and the organization of the firm in a globalizing world, (iii) industrial organization with a focus on the determinants of the boundaries of the firm, and (iv) networks with a focus on the role of social and regional networks, and on standards as institutionalized settings that facilitate exchange of goods, ideas, etc."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nInteractive lectures."", ""Method of Assessment\nIndividual paper and presentation, and optional assignments."", ""Literature\nAn extensive reading list is made available at the start of the course."", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nSecond and third year participants in the honours program."", ""Custom Course Registration\nSBE rules and dates apply for this SBE HP course."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nBasic familiarity with the principles of economics and statistics.""]"

Accordingly, it is crucial for many companies to successfully manage their activities at an international or global scale. However, in most cases, home country practices cannot be simply “spilled over” to foreign markets. On top of that, companies operating across borders continuously face global challenges that persist or newly emerge.\nThe objective of this course is thus not only to familiarize students with and give an overview of the unique characteristics and peculiarities of the “international side of management”, also and especially from a functional perspective. The course is also intended for students to develop the ability to propose recommendations for internationally or globally active companies (and their functions) in the face of (global) megatrends. CIIM aims to develop students’ team-working and professional communication skills and enables them to think beyond the borders of the individual organization/company.\nThis course contributes to the SBE's Bridging Theory and Practice overall learning goal. After completing the course, students should:\nHave thorough knowledge of relevant theory and methods in the context of International Management, and an evidence-based approach to solving complex international/global business problems; in other words, students show knowledge of fundamental International Management theory and are able to use theory to solve complex practical problems of managing in international contexts.\nHave the professional and social skills to interact with other professionals; students should be able to express their solutions to practical problems verbally and in writing."", ""Course Content\nThe lectures start with a general introduction of International Management, its development and definitory remarks.

Differences between domestically-oriented functions and internationally/globally oriented functions will be highlighted. Based on this, it will be discussed how international company functions can be managed successfully in today’s world.\nThe tutorials will give students the opportunity to discuss and receive feedback on their podcast projects, in which they link contemporary megatrends with the International Management of (a) specific company function(s) with the help of theoretical/conceptual frameworks and expert input.

You will also present the results of your research to others in an accessible and understandable manner, by writing essays and a thesis. A crucial first step in this process is to be able to describe clearly and accurately what scholars before you have written about the subject, and what questions remain unanswered. This is called the ‘status quaestionis’. During this course, you will acquire the necessary skills to write a good status quaestionis with proper annotations, which results in a relevant research question.\nA first skill implies gathering and evaluating scientific information. You will be introduced to the organization and facilities of the VU’s library (UBVU). You will also be acquainted with the conventions on describing and registering bibliographical data in footnotes and bibliographies. Additionally, we will discuss digital forms of information gathering, such as the use of online catalogues, (academic) search engines, and bibliographical reference works.\nThe ability to make a critical assessment of information is a crucial skill for historians. Anyone conducting research for an essay, course assignment, or thesis, will be constantly confronted with a myriad of facts, knowledge, and interpretations. The value of those is not inherently established. In ‘Academic Skills for Historians’, you will learn how to assess the reliability and partiality of information.\nA second crucial academic ability is the processing and interpreting of information. How do you summarize a scientific article or an academic debate? How do you distinguish between a well-founded and an unsubstantiated opinion? What is the research question put forward in a scholarly article and how does it relate to broader issues? Which approach was adopted by the author, and which primary sources have been used? How did the author justify their methodology?\nDuring the course, you will write your own status quaestionis, step by step, according to the rules of the profession. A status quaestionis is a summary of existing knowledge on a certain theme which leads towards a clear research question. Through several practical exercises, you will be acquainted with all aspects of the writing process. You will learn how to find other articles and books on the same topic, how to write a good summary, how to structure a text, how to present arguments of others and how to use your own voice, and how to formulate a good research question. Next to addressing these issues, the teachers will also discuss practical matters such as work organization, writing strategies, planning and time management.

After a temporary breakdown in smaller entities we find that during the first millennium BCE a sequence of empires were carved out by Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. In about the same period, we can follow the evolution of the Greek city-states, notably Sparta and Athens, which eventually clashed with the Persian empire. The struggle for hegemony in the Aegean world between some of the larger Greek city states and the emergence of the Macedonian kingdom as the hegemonic power form the prelude to Alexander the Great conquering the Persian Empire. After his death this broke down into smaller empires ruled by Macedonian dynasties in Egypt and Western Asia until their demise as the result of the emergence of such new powers as the Parthian Empire and the Roman Republic which, evolving into the Imperium Romanum, conquered the Mediterranean world at the close of the first millennium BCE.

We will begin with the origins of Rome as a major city state in central Italy, initially ruled by kings, but a Republic since the late sixth century BCE. We study the internal developments in the Early Republic (fifth to third centuries BCE), especially the so-called Struggle of the Orders (Patricians and Plebeians), resulting in a compromise and a curious oligarchic constitutional system. We will see how Rome, from the fourth century BCE onwards, first became the ruling power of Italy, subsequently to conquer the Mediterranean in a series of wars against Carthage and the kingdoms founded by the successors of Alexander the Great. We will also see that Roman expansion had devastating effects on internal stability: in the first century BCE the Republic crumbled in a series of civil wars, and by the turn of the Common Era a monarchic system had been established. The holders of monarchic power in this system are nowadays usually (at least in English) labelled ‘emperors’ (from Latin imperator, meaning something like ‘commander-in-chief’).\nThe first and second centuries CE were for the Roman Empire, now encompassing the Mediterranean and a considerable part of north-western Europe, a period of stability guaranteed by military superiority and accompanied by progressive integration of the population of the provinces in the Roman citizenry. This stability was shaken in the third century, when the Empire was confronted with a severe crisis which it survived, although not without considerable adaptations in the administrative, military, and ideological sphere.\nIn Late Antiquity (from the fourth century onwards), the Roman Empire in north-western Europe and the western Mediterranean was superseded by Germanic kingdoms. In the Eastern Mediterranean, however, it survived as what we now call the Byzantine Empire. In addition to the events and developments here sketched, we will also go into more structural aspects of Roman history: social relations, economic developments, class conflict, political institutions, law, warfare, and last but not least changes in the religious sphere. The dominant position of Christianity in European history is, after all, a legacy of the Roman Empire.\nFinally, in January we will return to classical Athens to examine how democracy was viewed there: Is it truly the best form of government?

You familiarize yourself with the large regional changes and with the ‘events and facts’ that those histories comprise: the lives and deeds of emperors, kings and warlords; the thought and influence of religious leaders and scholars; the development of trade routes and trading ports; the formation and collapse of empires and states and much more. This also includes some geographic orientation as you need to know not only when things happened but where they happened.\nWorking with a textbook is a two-step learning process, consisting of skills training and textbook training. This first step of learning we call skills training. First you attend a lecture on Monday (mandatory), introducing the textbook chapter, and a lecture about a topic that is of special interest for the period concerned, for example, the Black Death in the period 1300-1500. You read and study the chapter of the week in the textbook Worlds Together, Worlds Apart thoroughly (see schedule of lectures).You must distinguish between the more and less important parts. For instance, you can underline or highlight the important key words, events and facts and you take notes. You also study the maps and the legends and distinguish which are the most important ones and how they express major spatial aspects of the main arguments and developments.""]"

We will begin with the origins of Rome as a major city state in central Italy, initially ruled by kings, but a Republic since the late sixth century BCE. We study the internal developments in the Early Republic (fifth to third centuries BCE), especially the so-called Struggle of the Orders (Patricians and Plebeians), resulting in a compromise and a curious oligarchic constitutional system. We will see how Rome, from the fourth century BCE onwards, first became the ruling power of Italy, subsequently to conquer the Mediterranean in a series of wars against Carthage and the kingdoms founded by the successors of Alexander the Great. We will also see that Roman expansion had devastating effects on internal stability: in the first century BCE the Republic crumbled in a series of civil wars, and by the turn of the Common Era a monarchic system had been established. The holders of monarchic power in this system are nowadays usually (at least in English) labelled ‘emperors’ (from Latin imperator, meaning something like ‘commander-in-chief’).\nThe first and second centuries CE were for the Roman Empire, now encompassing the Mediterranean and a considerable part of north-western Europe, a period of stability guaranteed by military superiority and accompanied by progressive integration of the population of the provinces in the Roman citizenry. This stability was shaken in the third century, when the Empire was confronted with a severe crisis which it survived, although not without considerable adaptations in the administrative, military, and ideological sphere.\nIn Late Antiquity (from the fourth century onwards), the Roman Empire in north-western Europe and the western Mediterranean was superseded by Germanic kingdoms. In the Eastern Mediterranean, however, it survived as what we now call the Byzantine Empire. In addition to the events and developments here sketched, we will also go into more structural aspects of Roman history: social relations, economic developments, class conflict, political institutions, law, warfare, and last but not least changes in the religious sphere. The dominant position of Christianity in European history is, after all, a legacy of the Roman Empire."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten examination (100%).

After 1945 all around the globe countries became independent, so what did that mean for Europe itself?

It seeks to inculcate a productive understanding of Africa’s place (past and present) in the world. Special attention is given to the dynamics that produced generations of African facilitators, as Joseph Miller has argued, “from the suppliers of slaves through post-colonial “gatekeeping” elites brokering flows of funds and commodities between national economies and international capital, often to their and their clients’ personal advantage.” An understanding of the relationship between sub-Saharan Africa and the world enriches understanding of both global connections and specific regional, sub-regional and local contexts.

Welke nieuwe invalshoeken, methoden of technieken zouden het onderzoek in een andere richting kunnen sturen? Anders dan bij een regulier werkstuk is je eigen onderzoeksvraag niet het begin, maar het sluitstuk van de status quaestionis. Je gaat dus geen onderzoek doen om een vooraf gestelde vraag te beantwoorden, maar je gaat onderzoeken welke vraag er nog gesteld zou moeten worden.\nOm te beginnen leer je hoe je wetenschappelijke informatie moet zoeken en beoordelen.\nJe wordt vertrouwd gemaakt met de inrichting en organisatie van de bibliotheek van de VU (UBVU), en met de conventies rond het beschrijven en opslaan van bibliografische gegevens in voetnoten en literatuurlijsten. Vervolgens komen allerlei elektronische vormen van informatievergaring aan de orde: het gebruik van online catalogi, zoekmachines en bibliografische naslagwerken. Het kritisch beoordelen van informatie is een belangrijke vaardigheid van de historicus. Wie in het kader van een werkstuk, collegeopdracht of scriptie onderzoek doet, wordt voortdurend geconfronteerd met allerlei soorten feiten, kennis en interpretaties waarvan de waarde niet op voorhand vaststaat. In de cursus AcVa leer je de betrouwbaarheid en partijdigheid van informatie beoordelen.\nEen tweede belangrijke academische vaardigheid is het verwerken en interpreteren van informatie: hoe vat je een wetenschappelijk artikel en een wetenschappelijk debat goed samen? Hoe maak je een onderscheid tussen gefundeerde argumenten en goedkope meningen? Wat is de probleemstelling van een artikel en wordt die afdoende beantwoord? Welke benadering is daarvoor gekozen en welke bronnen heeft de auteur gebruikt? Hoe is die keuze verantwoord?\nVervolgens schrijf je stap voor stap een status quaestionis, een samenvatting van de bestaande kennis over een thema, die uitmondt in een eigen onderzoeksvraag. Aan de hand van praktische oefeningen komen alle aspecten van het schrijfproces aan de orde, vanaf het eerste idee tot de laatste tekstrevisie.

In about the same period, we can follow the evolution of the Greek city-states, notably Sparta and Athens, which eventually clashed with the Persian empire. The struggle for hegemony in the Aegean world between some of the larger Greek city states and the emergence of the Macedonian kingdom as the hegemonic power form the prelude to Alexander the Great conquering the Persian Empire. After his death this broke down into smaller empires ruled by Macedonian dynasties in Egypt and Western Asia until their demise as the result of the emergence of such new powers as the Parthian Empire and the Roman Republic which, evolving into the Imperium Romanum, conquered the Mediterranean world at the close of the first millennium BCE.

We will begin with the origins of Rome as a major city state in central Italy, initially ruled by kings, but a Republic since the late sixth century BCE. We study the internal developments in the Early Republic (fifth to third centuries BCE), especially the so-called Struggle of the Orders (Patricians and Plebeians), resulting in a compromise and a curious oligarchic constitutional system. We will see how Rome, from the fourth century BCE onwards, first became the ruling power of Italy, subsequently to conquer the Mediterranean in a series of wars against Carthage and the kingdoms founded by the successors of Alexander the Great. We will also see that Roman expansion had devastating effects on internal stability: in the first century BCE the Republic crumbled in a series of civil wars, and by the turn of the Common Era a monarchic system had been established. The holders of monarchic power in this system are nowadays usually (at least in English) labelled ‘emperors’ (from Latin imperator, meaning something like ‘commander-in-chief’).\nThe first and second centuries CE were for the Roman Empire, now encompassing the Mediterranean and a considerable part of north-western Europe, a period of stability guaranteed by military superiority and accompanied by progressive integration of the population of the provinces in the Roman citizenry. This stability was shaken in the third century, when the Empire was confronted with a severe crisis which it survived, although not without considerable adaptations in the administrative, military, and ideological sphere.\nIn Late Antiquity (from the fourth century onwards), the Roman Empire in north-western Europe and the western Mediterranean was superseded by Germanic kingdoms. In the Eastern Mediterranean, however, it survived as what we now call the Byzantine Empire. In addition to the events and developments here sketched, we will also go into more structural aspects of Roman history: social relations, economic developments, class conflict, political institutions, law, warfare, and last but not least changes in the religious sphere. The dominant position of Christianity in European history is, after all, a legacy of the Roman Empire.\nFinally, in January we will return to classical Athens to examine how democracy was viewed there: Is it truly the best form of government?

Beide revoluties brachten diepgaande culturele veranderingen teweeg en leidden tot de opkomst van een moderne wereld gebaseerd op rechten en democratisch bestuur. Evenzeer zijn de vooraanstaande figuren van deze revoluties tot in het heden bekend—soms positief, soms negatief—als de architecten en vertegenwoordigers van deze dynamische periode in de trans-Atlantische geschiedenis. Op de een of andere manier hebben we allemaal weleens gehoord van enkele Founding Fathers of Franse Jakobijnen. In dit vak maken studenten nader kennis met de politieke en culturele transformaties uit het revolutionaire tijdvak tussen 1770 en 1850, en de betekenis daarvan voor de ontwikkeling van moderne politiek. Een nadere bestudering van de Amerikanse en Fraanse Revoluties biedt daartoe een uitstekende mogelijkheid, ook vanuit een internationaal perspectief, omdat deze revolutie duidelijk is verbonden met andere 'Atlantische Revoluties' en zelfs 'Global Revolutions' uit dit tijdperk.\nMaar deze cursus stelt de vraag: hoeveel weten we écht over deze twee revolutionaire momenten? En hoeveel weten we daadwerkelijk over deze beroemde revolutionaire figuren? Hoe ervoeren zij de veranderende wereld om hen heen? Hoe begrepen zij hun rol in de revolutionaire onrust? Hoe zijn zij de symbolen geworden van hun respectieve politieke bewegingen?\nIn deze cursus bestuderen we de evoluerende geschiedschrijving over deze revoluties en de leidende figuren in deze revolutionaire gebeurtenissen. Vaak worden deze individuen onderworpen aan interpretatie, zowel in populaire media als in academische debatten. Door hun biografieën kunnen we niet alleen meer te weten over hun historische realiteit, maar ook over hoe historici, auteurs en het publiek hen hebben geportretteerd. Deze perspectieven zijn van belang, omdat ze onze hedendaagse opvattingen over deze revoluties en hun nalatenschap beïnvloeden. Hoe we over deze individuen schrijven—of het nu als vertegenwoordigers van hun tijd of als belichamingen van bepaalde politieke ideologieën is—blijft een sterk gepolitiseerd onderwerp."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nCombinatie van hoor- en werkcolleges.

It seeks to inculcate a productive understanding of Africa’s place (past and present) in the world. Special attention is given to the dynamics that produced generations of African facilitators, as Joseph Miller has argued, “from the suppliers of slaves through post-colonial “gatekeeping” elites brokering flows of funds and commodities between national economies and international capital, often to their and their clients’ personal advantage.” An understanding of the relationship between sub-Saharan Africa and the world enriches understanding of both global connections and specific regional, sub-regional and local contexts.

In turn, the modes of collecting, organising and displaying influenced the way the public thought about themselves and their culture.\nBy means of an introduction, all students and the professor each bring their own object to reflect on its personal meaning and the message to future generations if it was to become part of a museum collection. A private collector, who will be invited to the introduction seminar, will do the same on her collection. This first day will end with a visit to a private house/small museum in the centre of Amsterdam.\nDuring the following sessions, we will visit the St. Bavo in Haarlem, the Royal Antiquity Society and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Dutch Open Air Museum in Arnhem, and the Collection Centre of the Netherlands in Amersfoort. In the end, this will give you a good overview of the seven above mentioned topics in relation to collecting and exhibiting"", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars, fieldwork, excursions."", ""Method of Assessment\nAssessments consist of active participation in the classroom, attendance of museum visits, completing written assignments, and a formal presentation."", ""Literature\nEileen Hooper-Greenhill, Museums and the Shaping of Knowledge.

We will begin with the origins of Rome as a major city state in central Italy, initially ruled by kings, but a Republic since the late sixth century BCE. We study the internal developments in the Early Republic (fifth to third centuries BCE), especially the so-called Struggle of the Orders (Patricians and Plebeians), resulting in a compromise and a curious oligarchic constitutional system. We will see how Rome, from the fourth century BCE onwards, first became the ruling power of Italy, subsequently to conquer the Mediterranean in a series of wars against Carthage and the kingdoms founded by the successors of Alexander the Great. We will also see that Roman expansion had devastating effects on internal stability: in the first century BCE the Republic crumbled in a series of civil wars, and by the turn of the Common Era a monarchic system had been established. The holders of monarchic power in this system are nowadays usually (at least in English) labelled ‘emperors’ (from Latin imperator, meaning something like ‘commander-in-chief’).\nThe first and second centuries CE were for the Roman Empire, now encompassing the Mediterranean and a considerable part of north-western Europe, a period of stability guaranteed by military superiority and accompanied by progressive integration of the population of the provinces in the Roman citizenry. This stability was shaken in the third century, when the Empire was confronted with a severe crisis which it survived, although not without considerable adaptations in the administrative, military, and ideological sphere.\nIn Late Antiquity (from the fourth century onwards), the Roman Empire in north-western Europe and the western Mediterranean was superseded by Germanic kingdoms. In the Eastern Mediterranean, however, it survived as what we now call the Byzantine Empire. In addition to the events and developments here sketched, we will also go into more structural aspects of Roman history: social relations, economic developments, class conflict, political institutions, law, warfare, and last but not least changes in the religious sphere.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship."", ""Course Content\nSBE HP students can choose to substitute their elective course for a high-quality RA, preferably in their third bachelor year. It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program. Entry level requirement may also be set for specific projects, which require certain quantitative or qualitative research skills. Typically, the second half of the last year in the honours programme may fit best when combining this with the BSc thesis.\nStudents engaging in an RA are required to notify the programme coordinator up-front, and send a project proposal for approval to honoursprogramma.sbe@vu.nl.\nThis proposal, developed jointly with the prospective supervisor, should include:\n1.

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application). In doing so, you practice skills such as abstraction and reasoning (Academic and Research Skills).\nAfter following this course you can:\ndescribe and explain the typical features of the regulatory framework of financial reporting in developed economies;\ndescribe common accounting practices for a selection of common transactions and events (e.g. income tax, currency translation, intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries) discussed in this course;\nfor the selected transactions and events: solve a given issue in the form of a motivated choice for a specific accounting treatment, journals entries and/or completed financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement);\nrecognize and explain in a given fragment from published financial statements how an item or transaction has been accounted for, or explain the reporting about such accounting in a news media item;\nuse and interpret selected regulatory texts to answer questions about mandatory or optional accounting and reporting practices."", ""Course Content\nExternal financial reporting in the form of annual or quarterly financial statements is the basis of communication between a company and financial stakeholders such as shareholders and other investors. Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets. However, they also have legal significance, and are important in corporate governance. For larger enterprises, preparing financial statements is a complex process.\nThis is not just because it is a challenge to properly represent the performance and economic position of complex businesses, but also because there are significant interests at stake. Financial reporting can go spectacularly wrong, as evidenced by major accounting scandals that happen from time to time. For that reason, an elaborate institutional framework of regulations and standards, audit, supervision and enforcement has been built up around the practice of financial reporting. This framework consists both of national elements (such as company law) and international elements (such as International Financial Reporting Standards).\nIn this course, you do not just develop your technical 'how' skills (e.g. preparing consolidated financial statements, or working out the effects of currency translation on reported numbers) but you also train yourself to ask the 'why' question. Why does it matter to this company to account for this transaction in this way? Is there a rule that must be followed? Or does it have a choice? Who decides? Why is the rule the way it is? Could it be improved?\nNot everybody finds it easy to switch between accounting technique and the wider context of standards, governance and economic interests in which this technique is applied, but it is an essential skill for everybody who works in a professional way with financial reporting, whether as controller, auditor, financial analyst, manager, investor, or supervisor. The fact that accounting always plays out in this wider context is what makes financial reporting a fascinating discipline with a unique character."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures and tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten exam (individual assessment), optional interim exam (individual assessment)"", ""Literature\nTextbook: Aerts, W. and P.

The course addresses the general (competitive) equilibrium. This includes a discussion of the concept of Pareto efficiency and the conditions under which efficiency can be reached. In this context social welfare is considered. The concept of Pareto efficiency is being compared to the concept of \""fair\"" allocation. Externalities and public goods are reasons for missing markets and may cause Pareto efficiency to be violated. Monopoly is a market structure that leads to absence of Pareto efficiency in the equilibrium. Causes of monopoly, such as the natural monopoly, are considered. Monopolists can use their power to conduct specific pricing strategies such as price discrimination. A market structure in between competition and monopoly is monopolistic competition. Firms in such markets have market power, but free entry drives profits to zero in the long run. In oligopolistic markets strategic interactions play an important role. Examples of such interactions are the decision to cooperate or not, and to deter entry or not. Game-theoretic methods provide insight in various aspects of the strategies. With the rise of information technology new structures emerged by which suppliers offer their products. Some specific issues in these new markets are discussed. An auction is an allocation mechanism with various applications, among which is the auctioning of radio frequencies. In auctions strategy game-theoretic aspects play a role as well. Information is a very important aspect in the functioning of markets. Information asymmetry can lead to market failure, but also induce agents to find mechanisms to signal information and to find incentive payment schemes that function even if information is incomplete.

After taking this course, you are able to characterize the relationship between government and market from an economic perspective.

In the course, general economic insights with regard to the relationship between \""market\"" and \""government\"" are developed and elaborated on the basis of practical and appealing examples.\nAt the core of the course is the concept of \""externalities\"" as an economic cause of environmental problems such as pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.

Eén van de gemene delers is dat er vaak gedegen onderzoek aan ten grondslag ligt. Zoals tijdens elke universitaire studie leer je als student Creatief Schrijven Nederlands zelfstandig onderzoek doen naar wetenschappelijke en literaire bronnen uit heden en verleden. Ook leer je de uitkomst ervan op inzichtelijke wijze presenteren in tekstvorm. Tijdens deze cursus raak je vertrouwd met de verschillende vaardigheden die daarvoor nodig zijn. Bovendien leer je nagaan in wat voor academische en in wat voor creatieve teksten je onderzoek zou kunnen uitmonden.\nOm te beginnen is zo’n vaardigheid het zoeken en beoordelen van wetenschappelijke informatie. Je raakt vertrouwd met de inrichting en organisatie van de bibliotheek van de VU (UBVU), en met de conventies rond het beschrijven en opslaan van bibliografische gegevens in voetnoten en literatuurlijsten. Vervolgens komen allerlei elektronische vormen van informatievergaring aan de orde: het gebruik van online catalogi, zoekmachines en bibliografische naslagwerken. Het kritisch beoordelen van informatie is een belangrijke vaardigheid van de onderzoeker. Wie in het kader van een werkstuk, collegeopdracht of scriptie onderzoek doet, wordt voortdurend geconfronteerd met allerlei soorten feiten, kennis en interpretaties waarvan de waarde niet op voorhand vaststaat. In de cursus AcVa leer je de betrouwbaarheid en partijdigheid van informatie beoordelen.\nEen tweede belangrijke academische vaardigheid is het verwerken en interpreteren van informatie: hoe vat je een wetenschappelijk artikel en een wetenschappelijk debat goed samen? Hoe maak je een onderscheid tussen gefundeerde argumenten en goedkope meningen? Wat is de probleemstelling van een artikel en wordt die afdoende beantwoord? Welke benadering is daarvoor gekozen en welke bronnen heeft de auteur gebruikt? Hoe is die keuze verantwoord?\nVervolgens schrijf je stap voor stap een status quaestionis: een samenvatting van de bestaande kennis over een thema, die uitmondt in een eigen onderzoeksvraag. Aan de hand van praktische oefeningen komen alle aspecten van het schrijfproces aan de orde, vanaf het eerste idee tot de laatste tekstrevisie. Daarbij leer je over een goede probleemstelling, aanpak, structuur en stijl. Daarnaast bespreken we ook praktische zaken zoals hoe het werk kan worden georganiseerd, schrijfstrategieën, planning en timemanagement.

Tegelijkertijd vinden er belangrijke ontwikkelingen plaats in de politieke en religieuze situatie in de Nederlanden, die leiden tot de vorming van de Republiek. In de zeventiende eeuw, de Gouden Eeuw, groeit ons land uit tot een wereldmacht. Bij de behandeling van de teksten ligt de nadruk, behalve op de literaire ontwikkelingen, ook steeds op de maatschappelijke rol die teksten in de samenleving hebben vervuld, van statusverhoging tot politiek wapen, en van vermaak tot emancipatoire kracht.

At the end of this course, students will be able to correctly define basic linguistic terminology and they will be able to describe the contents of the following linguistic domains: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, language variation, computational linguistics, child language acquisition and language disorders. Students will also be able to perform basic linguistic analyses on language datasets from languages they do not speak."", ""Course Content\nIn this course, we will study the basics of linguistics and applied linguistics. We start out with studying the language acquisition processes young children go through. We will focus on the developmental processes in sound, word and sentence acquisition. We will also pay some attention to language disorders, such as developmental disorders and aphasia. Taking language acquisition as a starting point, we will then study the systems for sound production, word formation and sentence construction as universal properties of languages. In our phonetics and phonology classes we will study how sounds are pronounced and perceived and how meaning is mapped onto sounds in different languages. We then move on to how words and sentences are formed in a number of languages and how this helps us categorize languages into families (topics: morphology and syntax). In the fourth week, we focus on how languages change from generation to generation and how language contact causes regional language change. In these first four weeks we will study language examples from English and Dutch but also from typologically completely different languages such as Austronesian languages and Amazonian languages. In week five, we will focus less on the language system itself and more on language use. We will study semantics (the mapping of meaning onto words or clauses) and pragmatics (the unwritten rules of language use). In the final week, we will focus on computational linguistics and we will study how computers learn and use language and how this differs from the way humans learn and use language. At the end of the course, students will have become acquainted with an enormous number of fascinating features of language systems and language use."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures (4 hrs per week) and seminars (2 hrs per week).

You will learn how philosophy helps to reflect on humanity and reality, in culturally differentiated ways.\nLearning objectives:\nYou will get insight into how philosophers/philosophy help(s) to understand one’s own culture and that of others\nYou will acquire tools to critically question the claims to universal reason of ‘Western’ thinking\nYou are able to critically reflect on how your own cultural background influences your understanding\nYou can reflect in a philosophical manner, both collectively (in seminars) and individually (through assignments)"", ""Course Content\nPhilosophy is a discipline that focuses more on questions than answers. Examples of philosophical questions are: What is reality? What can human beings know? How do our academic frameworks steer our understanding? How does knowledge inform our practical life, and our morality?\nIn this course, we will focus on the intercultural aspects of philosophy, which center on the question of understanding. Human thinking is formed and rooted in cultures. These are not fixed, bounded wholes, but we are able to learn another culture from the inside by living in it, and can go back and forth through different cultures. How do we, however, translate between cultures? And how can we understand someone who is formed to think in another language, with different moral rules?\nDue to colonialism, often in philosophy, Eurocentric philosophical traditions are centered while other forms of philosophy are neglected. From the end of the 20th century, German and Austrian philosophers have formed a school of Intercultural Philosophy as a way to address this. You will get acquainted with their approach, and with further developments of their thought by other philosophers. Using the intercultural philosophy approach, you will zoom in on the question of ‘Self-hood’ by reflecting on philosophies from African and Asian cultures."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nEach week there are two lectures, and one seminar, for a total of 5.25 contact hours per week.

The ability to influence people in ways they can act against their own interests is what political scientists describe as power. Data analytics as an instrument to develop knowledge and facilitate the exercise of power is a phenomenon that requires regulation. Power in a constitutional democracy, whether exercised by the state or other parties, has to be subject to the law. Law offers the option to mediate between conflicting interests guiding toward a legal solution to a problem rather than one which is based on brute force.\nPrivacy is a societal norm that is codified in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. EU data protection legislation in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the processing of personal data in EU member states. Privacy and data protection is a funny pair that have provoked many lawyers to write relentless essays on. Gutwirth and De Hert, two prominent privacy and data protection lawyers from Belgium, use an interesting distinction between the two. They refer to privacy as an opacity instrument, because it protects a sphere in which the individual's behaviour is not being recorded. They refer to data protection as a transparency instrument, because it makes the exercise of power knowledgeable for those who are on the receiving end. Privacy and data protection laws offer rules that can be complied with by parties who want to use data analytics in their strategies and policies.\nIn this course, the basics of privacy and data protection law are explained in the context of data analytics. The idea is for students of computer science to understand the basics of the law and for students of law to understand the basics of data analytics.

Metabolomics is a rapidly emerging field in molecular biology, and is one of the so-called omics technologies (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Metabolomics measures small molecules – the metabolites – in the cell or organism with the aim of determining the health status. But it can also determine the influence of the environment on health, for example through diet or exposure to toxic substances. Examples of metabolites are amino acids, ATP, sugars, neurotransmitters, lipids, etc.\nMetabolomics aims to measure the complete set of metabolites (the metabolome) in organisms and is widely used in the medical, toxicological, and biological field. Metabolites function in a network and are transported to the desired destination via the streets as in a city. Metabolites have a major influence on the phenotype, behavior but also on the development of organisms.\nThis course aims to provide insight into the principles of metabolism in organisms, how metabolomics can be used in practice, how metabolites can be determined in organisms, and how the large amount of data can be handled, processed, visualized and statistically analysed (Big data analysis). The course has a practical approach and consists of lectures followed by a metabolomics experiment (practical). The practical is an important part of the course in which the student will conduct an experiment with zebrafish eggs and determine metabolites in the zebrafish embryos. Another important part is the processing of the large amount of data generated by using data visualization and statistical tools (introduction to processing of Big Data).\nThe following topics are covered:\nWhat is metabolomics\nWhat are metabolic networks\nBasic principles and workflows for determining and processing metabolite data\nMethods for the analysis of metabolites\nApplications of metabolomics\nSetting up a metabolomics experiment\nProcessing and analysis of large data (visualization, metabolite networks, statistical analysis)\nThe practical is an important part of the course to give the student a better insight into the various aspects of metabolomics. The student carries out a metabolomics experiment with zebrafish eggs, whereby the development from egg to embryo is monitored. The metabolites (lipids and neurotransmitters) are determined, and the data is processed, among other things by visualizing the data, creating metabolic networks and statistically processing the data.\nThe learning objectives at the end of the course are:\nThe student has knowledge and insight into the topics covered from metabolomics in cells and organism: The interactions between metabolites, proteins and genes.\nThe student has insight into the methods of measuring metabolites and the challenges of studying the metabolome.\nThe student gains experience with chemical analysis methods and the analysis of large data sets.\nThe student has practical experience in setting up and conducting a metabolomics experiment.\nThe student can process and analyse collected experimental data and can do the interpretation."", ""Course Content\nThe course provides an introduction to metabolomics and will discuss and use the tools and techniques (practical) needed to conduct a metabolomics study. Various applications of metabolomics in biology, medical and toxicological fields will be discussed. A focus point in the course is the performance of a metabolomics experiment in which you will work with eggs of zebrafish. You follow the development from egg to embryo, determine lipids and neurotransmitters in the embryos, and process and analyse the large amount of data.\nIn this course a large number of fundamental and practical topics from metabolism and metabolomics are covered such as:\nMetabolic Networks\nMetabolomics (principles, workflows in metabolomics, applications)\nIntroduction to chemical analysis methods (chromatography, mass spectrometry)\nIntroduction to data processing (including visualization and Big data analysis)\nIn the practical, the students will apply the material from the lectures via a metabolomics experiment with zebrafish to understand the principles of metabolic networks, the use of analytical equipment to determine metabolites, and the processing and analysis of large data sets."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures (18 hours)\nMetabolomics practical (28 hours)\nData processing (20 hours)\nPresentation (16 hours)\nPracticum report (8 hours)\nSelf-study (78 hours)"", ""Method of Assessment\nExamination (1/3 of the final grade, average grade at least 5.5).\nPresentation (1/3 of the final grade, average grade at least 5.5).\nPracticum report (1/3 of the final grade, average grade at least 5.5).\nAttending practicals and working groups must be sufficient."", ""Literature\nBackground literature, not needed, Metabolome analysis : an introduction.

The structure of a module can be very complicated, but in case the ring is a principal ideal domain and the module is generated by finitely many elements, there is a structure theorem (the Fundamental Theorem for Finitely Generated Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain) that states how one can describe all such modules, up to isomorphism, in a unique way. For example, if the ring is the set of integers, then a finitely generated module is precisely the same as a finitely generated Abelian group, and such a group is isomorphic (as a group) to the product of finitely many cyclic groups; this is part of the Fundamental Theorem for Finitely Generated Abelian Groups, which also states the conditions to choose such a product uniquely. If the ring is a polynomial ring in one variable with coefficients in a field then the corresponding statement for a finitely generated module over it can be used to give a standard form for a square matrix with coefficients in the field (its rational canonical form).

It starts from the assumption that the spaces we inhabit, populate, navigate, that we are confronted with or immersed in, are built and formatted, increasingly technologically wired, interactive and interconnected.\nIn other words: environments become interfaces for mediating experience, privileging certain uses and, at the same time, constraining others. Urban environments have become ‘smart’; the Internet of Things connects physical and virtual space in new and highly efficient ways; environmentalist intervention as well as political agendas and policies depend on monitoring ecology and generating data of current conditions (of e.g. air and water pollution or climate change) by means of sensor-media; large technological infrastructures intertwine place and space, the local and the global. Yet, it would be short-sighted to only conceive of these processes as recent developments enabled by 'digitality'. The course therefore draws a historical line to situate current conditions of mediating environments in the context of a shared genealogy of architectural design and technological processes of mediation.\nThe aim of the course is to develop a critical understanding of traditional and contemporary places, spaces, buildings, infrastructures and technologies.

The meaning of the concept of (World) heritage has radically changed throughout the last decades; whilst initially World Heritage designations were limited to objects and buildings, increasingly sites and (cultural) landscapes are considered as well. There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past. During this course, conflicts will be addressed by discussing case studies, visiting heritage sites, reflecting on the way in which UNESCO seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage of “outstanding value to humanity”, and debating how heritage is co-created in national and local scales."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars, excursions."", ""Method of Assessment\nGroup assignment during seminar 1 (15%): learning objectives 2, 3, and 5\nGroup assignment during seminar 2 (15%): learning objectives 1, 4, and 5\nGroup assignment during self-guided excursion (15%): learning objectives 3 and 4\nIndividual essay assignment (in class) (55%) :learning objectives 1, 2, and 4\nEnd terms BA MKDA: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12"", ""Literature\ncourse literature to be announced in Canvas"", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nBA2 students Geschiedenis variant History & Heritage;\nBA 2 students History and International Studies; BA2 and BA3 MKDA students;\nInternational humanities students, level 200-300."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nFor international exchange students a basic knowledge of (art or architectural) history or heritage studies. is required (on level 200-300).""]"

Examples of philosophical questions are: What is reality? What can human beings know? How do our academic frameworks steer our understanding? How does knowledge inform our practical life, and our morality?\nIn this course, we will focus on the intercultural aspects of philosophy, which center on the question of understanding. Human thinking is formed and rooted in cultures. These are not fixed, bounded wholes, but we are able to learn another culture from the inside by living in it, and can go back and forth through different cultures. How do we, however, translate between cultures? And how can we understand someone who is formed to think in another language, with different moral rules?\nDue to colonialism, often in philosophy, Eurocentric philosophical traditions are centered while other forms of philosophy are neglected. From the end of the 20th century, German and Austrian philosophers have formed a school of Intercultural Philosophy as a way to address this.

The meaning of the concept of (World) heritage has radically changed throughout the last decades; whilst initially World Heritage designations were limited to objects and buildings, increasingly sites and (cultural) landscapes are considered as well. There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past.

Skills to be developed include the critical observation of original works of art in museums, the visual determination of the most important painting and printmaking techniques, and the application of the correct terminology for the visual and iconographic analysis of works of art.

The creation or production of works of art took place under artistic, intellectual, religious, political, or social conditions that either directly or more subtly influenced the reception of those works of art in later periods. At the same time, new developments such as the scholarly approach to art-historical research, the creation of institutions like public art museums, or the development of techniques of reproduction have added new dimensions to the reception of art in general.\nTherefore, understanding the production and reception of art provides the opportunity to connect the history of art works with current debates. Under the theme of production, this course provides lectures on studio practice and art theory, the role of the patron, and on the fragmentary character of early modern art. Under the theme of reception, attention is paid to the (historical) reputation artists, the practice of collecting and displaying art, and recent insights into the global context of early modern art.

The meaning of the concept of (World) heritage has radically changed throughout the last decades; whilst initially World Heritage designations were limited to objects and buildings, increasingly sites and (cultural) landscapes are considered as well. There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past. During this course, conflicts will be addressed by discussing case studies, visiting heritage sites, reflecting on the way in which UNESCO seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage of “outstanding value to humanity”, and debating how heritage is co-created in national and local scales."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures, seminars, excursions."", ""Method of Assessment\nGroup assignment during seminar 1 (15%): learning objectives 2, 3, and 5\nGroup assignment during seminar 2 (15%): learning objectives 1, 4, and 5\nGroup assignment during self-guided excursion (15%): learning objectives 3 and 4\nIndividual essay assignment (in class) (55%) :learning objectives 1, 2, and 4\nEnd terms BA MKDA: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12"", ""Literature\ncourse literature to be announced in Canvas"", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nBA2 students Geschiedenis variant History & Heritage;\nBA 2 students History and International Studies; BA2 and BA3 MKDA students;\nInternational humanities students, level 200-300."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nFor international exchange students a basic knowledge of (art or architectural) history or heritage studies. is required (on level 200-300).""]"

Examples of philosophical questions are: What is reality? What can human beings know? How do our academic frameworks steer our understanding? How does knowledge inform our practical life, and our morality?\nIn this course, we will focus on the intercultural aspects of philosophy, which center on the question of understanding. Human thinking is formed and rooted in cultures. These are not fixed, bounded wholes, but we are able to learn another culture from the inside by living in it, and can go back and forth through different cultures. How do we, however, translate between cultures? And how can we understand someone who is formed to think in another language, with different moral rules?\nDue to colonialism, often in philosophy, Eurocentric philosophical traditions are centered while other forms of philosophy are neglected. From the end of the 20th century, German and Austrian philosophers have formed a school of Intercultural Philosophy as a way to address this. You will get acquainted with their approach, and with further developments of their thought by other philosophers.

It starts from the assumption that the spaces we inhabit, populate, navigate, that we are confronted with or immersed in, are built and formatted, increasingly technologically wired, interactive and interconnected.\nIn other words: environments become interfaces for mediating experience, privileging certain uses and, at the same time, constraining others. Urban environments have become ‘smart’; the Internet of Things connects physical and virtual space in new and highly efficient ways; environmentalist intervention as well as political agendas and policies depend on monitoring ecology and generating data of current conditions (of e.g. air and water pollution or climate change) by means of sensor-media; large technological infrastructures intertwine place and space, the local and the global. Yet, it would be short-sighted to only conceive of these processes as recent developments enabled by 'digitality'.

The meaning of the concept of (World) heritage has radically changed throughout the last decades; whilst initially World Heritage designations were limited to objects and buildings, increasingly sites and (cultural) landscapes are considered as well. There is also increasing attention to immaterial forms of cultural heritage, such as artistic practices, craftsmanship and traditions. Thanks to the contribution of critical heritage studies, it is now acknowledged that, whether objects or landscape, tangible or intangible, heritage values are not intrinsic but constructed by stakeholders and communities. It is also clear that World Heritage is never undisputed and often gives rise to conflicts, ranging from armed crises to disputes relating to the management of heritage, as connected to national identities, historical traumas, tourism and economic developments, or climate and environmental changes.\nIn this module, we will specifically focus on the relationship between (World) Heritage and such conflicts. By discussing critically recent academic, political, and public debates on individual World Heritage sites, students will reflect upon what is called the ‘heritage paradox’ – the constant tension between the management of future changes and to urge to protect relics of the past.

What is the 'traditional' conception of knowledge and what (if anything) is wrong with it?\nPhilosophical analysis: How should we understand epistemological concepts — should they be conceptually analyzed? How do we do that?\nTheory of Justification: What makes a belief justified or rational? Can you be rational in thinking what you do without knowing that your thinking is rational?\nSkepticism: Can we refute skepticism? How?\nPerception: How does perception give us knowledge and rational belief.\nTestimony: How does testimony give us knowledge and rational belief.\nEcho chambers: Can we escape echo chambers?

Knowledge and understanding of the contemporary political and political-philosophical landscape: you are able to recognize the most important viewpoints/political ideologies within contemporary political philosophy and the contemporary political landscape, you can indicate the core convictions of each of them and how each ideology relates to the other ones.\n2. Philosophical analysis: you can identify and understand the underlying presuppositions of the various schools of thought and critically analyze these presuppositions.\n3. Getting acquainted with \""famous texts\"": for each movement you can indicate why a particular text fragment from the tradition of political philosophy is typical or foundational for a particular political-philosophical movement.\n4. Analysis of current ‘hot topics’ in the public-political sphere: you will study a number of current social themes and learn to recognize how different schools of thought think about these issues. You will also learn to formulate and argue your own point of view, in an interdisciplinary context with students from other VU-faculties.\nSkills:\n5. Learning to identify key points in the study material: every week you write a short reflection on readings.\n6. Debating skills: a round of debates is held every week in which we try to determine the 'solving potential' of a particular school of thought for an urgent social problem. You will make a brief analysis of this problem on the basis of internet, newspapers and magazine articles and statistical data and you will learn to introduce the results of your analysis briefly and (hopefully) convincingly in a debate.\n7. Dialogue and reflection: In the VU-wide Broader Mind Course associated with this course you learn to approach personal and social themes from various disciplinary perspectives, to reflect on them and to discuss these themes with students from very different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds."", ""Course Content\nPolitical philosophy or political theory (often used interchangeably) deals with hot topics in today’s society. Together we explore the ideas and visions that people use when designing, redesigning or assessing the way their society is organized. In this course you get to know the most important past and contemporary ideologies within the modern political spectrum, such as liberalism, socialism, feminism, ecological thinking. We also look - particularly during the lectures - at the historical-cultural background of these ideologies: where do they come from, what are the core ideas?\nAnd we practice as well public debates, and reflecting on your own opinions, together with people from very different backgrounds. Listening is as important as talking. This is partly done in the lectures, partly in the university-wide Broader Mind Course, which is associated with this course.\nWe always try to do this in an informed, academic way: arguments are key. But in the selection of arguments political ideologies are important maps for people. In the past, from Plato, but certainly in modern times, all kinds of ideas and visions have been formed that inspire people and on which people rely on in dealing with issues in society.\nThe course has two parts. The main part will be offered in Period 1. Next to this you will participate, with your philosophical background acquired in Period 1, in the university-wide offered Broader Mind Course, which is organized in the spring (period 4 and 5, in total 40 hours), in which you will meet students from all faculties of the VU and together work on and discuss themes that focus on personal development and societal challenges (and the relations between those). Through a smart mix of online assignments and carefully scheduled meet-ups is the Broader MInd Course organized in such a way that it can be very well combined with other courses.\nIn the main course, we will study poltical ideologies and apply these already to current societal issues as well as to some themes that will be discussed as well in the Broader Mind Course. What do the various political ideologies have to say on inequality, on climate change, on abortion rights, on drugs use, on education? You may self choose the topic that you want to explore and discuss. them. Discussions will take place as 'talkshows'."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nIn Period 1: Watching videoclips on the main materials, class discussions and collective readings, debates/talkshows. The Broader Mind part consists of 'blended learning': online assignments, to be fullfilled at a time of your own choosing, and offline meetups in interdisciplinary groups of 25 students, working together on experience-based learning assignments. In total the Broader MInd part will take about 40 hours, over 4 months, so about 2,5 hours per week, no activities in exam periods.\nIf for certain reasons it really is not possible to take the Broader Mind Course in the Spring, there is a special Autumn group that can take this course simultaneously the current couse in the first semester."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten assignments and participation in talkshows (both: pass/ fail), meant to practice goals 4,5, 6\nWritten exam that will determine your grade (Goals 1,2,3)\nBroader Mind certificate which will validate your grade (achieving goals 4,6,7)"", ""Literature\nKey reading is Andrew Heywood, Political Ideologies.

Postcolonial Theory and Intercultural Philosophy represent two different approaches geared towards such repair. We will study them and some classic authors that created these approaches. We will look into their historical contexts, and analyze where they conflict and where they complement each other. We will do all of this by means of critical text-reading, group dialogue, and forming one’s own (argued) view of the course materials in writing.\nThe Western canon is a term we use for the body of philosophical work that self-identifies as rooted in ancient Greek philosophical thought and reached its pinnacle in the North-European Enlightenment. It is supposed to be most rational and has a universal reach to enlighten ‘all mankind’. The canon construed its own history of rational progress (Park 2013), while projecting an ’other’ to differentiate itself from. This other historically comprised a variety of thinkers from many parts of the world that may be sexualized (e.g. female thinkers’) racialized (as ‘black’ or ‘indian’) or culturalized (as Asian, African, indigenous native American, etc.).\nPostcolonial Theory is the name for a body of critical thought that arose around the time of political decolonization and that persisted in the decades after up till now as a critique of neocolonial situations. It also includes critiques of racial oppression in its systemic forms.\nIntercultural Philosophy has its roots in the increasing encounters between people through globalization, migration and communication by all kinds of different means. In Europe it had its systematic formulation in the 1990s and is based upon thinkers of dialogue such as Hans-Georg Gadamer.

Krijnen,"Seminar, Lecture",Hide full list (1); Philosophy,"[""Course Objective\nThe goal of this course is to acquire insight into a classical text of the history of philosophy: Kant’s “Kritik der reinen Vernunft”. This text is treated on a textual level but also positioned in the perspective of a broader framework of the history of philosophy, in particular that of metaphysics and empiricism.\nAfter this course,\nyou can explain basic concepts of Kant’s KrV in your own words;\nyou have obtained insight into the basic question of the KrV as well as in its argumentation and structure;\nyou can position Kant’s transcendental philosophy in the history of philosophy;\nyou can read and analyze texts of Kant by yourself;\nyou have developed more general academical skills like close reading of texts, discussing them critically, and writing about them."", ""Course Content\nIn his \""Kritik der reinen Vernunft\"" (1781/1787), the first of his three critical works, Kant developed his famous as well as infamous philosophical ‘Copernican turn’ with respect to our knowledge claims. The significance of the KrV for the history of philosophy can hardly be overestimated. Kant's conception of ‘transcendental philosophy’ aims to supply philosophy with a completely new foundation, namely a ‘critical’ foundation. According to Kant, both metaphysics and empiricism are uncritical regarding their own presupposition. Hence, Kant’s KrV not only establishes a new philosophical paradigm but at the same time positions this paradigm within the history of philosophy. For many philosophers, Kant’s transcendental philosophy showed to be a source, a standard, and of course an instance that is in need of criticism itself. The history of philosophy cannot be understood properly without knowledge of Kant’s philosophy. It seems that a philosophy that falls back behind to Kant’s position does not have a long future. In the course, we study in great detail the Einleitung of the KrV (= 2e editie, B 1-30), parts from the Transzendentale Ästhetik and the Transzendentale Logik (Analytik der Begriffe). We start with the Einleitung, following the order of the sections, and hence start with the first section. It is recommended to have read the whole Einleitung before the first meeting. At least, students are supposed to have prepared §§ 1-3 (B 1-10) for the first meeting.

Postkoloniale Theorie en Interculturele Filosofie vertegenwoordigen twee verschillende benaderingen die gericht zijn op een dergelijke correctie. We bestuderen in deze cursus enkele klassieke auteurs die deze benaderingen hebben ingezet, alsmede de algemene karakteristieken van die benaderingen. We bekijken hen in hun historische context en analyseren hoe en wanneer ze met elkaar conflicteren en/of elkaar complementeren. We doen dit door middel van kritische tekst lezing, groepsgesprekken, en het vormen van onze eigen (beargumenteerde) visie op het cursusmateriaal in mondelinge en schriftelijke vorm.\nDe Westerse canon is een term die we gebruiken voor een verzameling filosofische werken die zichzelf beschouwt als geworteld in het antieke Griekse filosofische denken, en die haar hoogtepunt bereikte in de Noord-Europese Verlichting. Deze werken worden verondersteld de hoogste rationaliteit te hebben gerealiseerd en vertrekken vanuit de ambitie om de hele mensheid te ‘verlichten’. De canon construeerde haar eigen geschiedenis als een van rationele vooruitgang (Park 2013), waarbij ze een ‘ander’ projecteerde om zichzelf van te onderscheiden. Deze ander kreeg door de tijd heen het gezicht van steeds weer andere denkers uit verschillende delen van de wereld. Zij werden geseksualiseerd (bijv. als vrouwelijke denkers), of naar ras (‘zwart’, ‘indianen’) of cultuur (Aziatisch, Afrikaans, etc.) gekenmerkt en weg gezet.\nPostkoloniale Theorie omvat een verzameling van kritisch werk dat opkwam voor en rond de tijd van de politieke dekolonisatie en dat zich voortzette in de decennia daarna tot op de dag van vandaag als een kritiek van neokoloniale situaties. Het omvat kritieken van op ras gebaseerde onderdrukking die als systemisch onderscheiden kunnen worden.\nInterculturele Filosofie heeft haar wortels in de toenemende ontmoetingen tussen volkeren door globalisatie, migratie en communicatie door verschillende media. In Europa kreeg zij haar systematische articulatie in de jaren ’90 van de vorige eeuw, en is ze voornamelijk gebaseerd op het denken over dialoog van bijvoorbeeld Hans-Georg Gadamer.

In dit vak wordt filosofie verbonden met het verkennen van maatschappelijke vragen en het oefenen in meningsvorming. Deels gebeurt dat in de colleges, deels in de universiteitsbrede Broader Mind Course, die aan dit vak is verbonden. In het verleden, al vanaf Plato, maar zeker in de moderne tijd zijn er allerlei ideeën en visioenen gevormd die mensen inspireren en waarop mensen zich beroepen bij het inrichten dan wel beoordelen van vraagstukken in de samenleving. Denk aan liberalisme, socialisme, feminisme, ecologisch denken, en nog heel wat meer. In dit college leer je de belangrijkste stromingen/ideologieën kennen binnen het moderne politieke spectrum. Tevens kijken we daarbij – met name tijdens de colleges - naar de historisch-culturele achtergrond van ideologieën.\nNog steeds zijn – sommige in sterkere mate, andere in mindere mate – ideologieën zeer invloedrijk in de vormgeving van samenlevingen. Ze vormen reservoirs van argumenten die bij allerlei vraagstukken die opkomen in het publieke debat worden gebruikt.

The significance of the KrV for the history of philosophy can hardly be overestimated. Kant's conception of ‘transcendental philosophy’ aims to supply philosophy with a completely new foundation, namely a ‘critical’ foundation. According to Kant, both metaphysics and empiricism are uncritical regarding their own presupposition. Hence, Kant’s KrV not only establishes a new philosophical paradigm but at the same time positions this paradigm within the history of philosophy. For many philosophers, Kant’s transcendental philosophy showed to be a source, a standard, and of course an instance that is in need of criticism itself. The history of philosophy cannot be understood properly without knowledge of Kant’s philosophy. It seems that a philosophy that falls back behind to Kant’s position does not have a long future. In the course, we study in great detail the Einleitung of the KrV (= 2e editie, B 1-30), parts from the Transzendentale Ästhetik and the Transzendentale Logik (Analytik der Begriffe). We start with the Einleitung, following the order of the sections, and hence start with the first section. It is recommended to have read the whole Einleitung before the first meeting.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program. Entry level requirement may also be set for specific projects, which require certain quantitative or qualitative research skills. Typically, the second half of the last year in the honours programme may fit best when combining this with the BSc thesis.\nStudents engaging in an RA are required to notify the programme coordinator up-front, and send a project proposal for approval to honoursprogramma.sbe@vu.nl.\nThis proposal, developed jointly with the prospective supervisor, should include:\n1.

Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program. Entry level requirement may also be set for specific projects, which require certain quantitative or qualitative research skills. Typically, the second half of the last year in the honours programme may fit best when combining this with the BSc thesis.\nStudents engaging in an RA are required to notify the programme coordinator up-front, and send a project proposal for approval to honoursprogramma.sbe@vu.nl.\nThis proposal, developed jointly with the prospective supervisor, should include:\n1. Research problem;\n2. Research question(s);\n3. Research design;\n4. Relevance;\n5. Structure of the research paper;\n6.

Why do some organizations prosper and grow, while others in the same industry go out of business and die? It turns out that answering these questions is not so simple ... and has motivated decades of scholarly research on strategic management.\nThis course will explore the core theoretical perspectives in the research that has examined these questions. We begin from the premise that the organization’s strategy is its approach to achieving success in general, and competitive advantage in particular. We then examine four theoretical perspectives that unpack this premise in very different ways and come to very different conclusions about the role of the manager in formulating and executing an organizational strategy. Developing a critical understanding of these different perspectives is important not only for aspiring managers, but also for anyone who wants to be an informed consumer of the business press and an active participant in today’s fast-paced global economy."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nLectures and tutorials."", ""Method of Assessment\nThe final grade will be composed of both individual (50%) and team-based (50%) components:\nIndividual components: quizzes, class participation and individual reflection paper\nTeam-based components: corporation analysis and living case studies"", ""Entry Requirements\nA basic understanding and acquaintance with the current world of business and economics (or a great passion and desire to understand and get acquainted) is expected of students in order to allow an in-depth discussion of the selected topics."", ""Literature\nWhittington, R.

This course elaborates on the costs and benefits of globalization introducing modern non-mainstream theories that at points challenge the traditional wisdom regarding the benefits of globalization and helps to understand the prevailing sentiments against globalization. We will heavily rely on insights from transaction cost theory which challenges the neglect in traditional neoclassical theory of transaction costs. The (oftentimes implicit) reliance in mainstream trade theory on frictionless trade is surprising for theories in which exchange is at the heart of the matter. This course aims to familiarize you with the concept of transaction costs and to show the relevance of transaction costs for understanding several of the empirical phenomena that are impossible to understand without relying on such costs.\nInsights are particularly relevant to appreciate current discussions on the impact of globalization on a small open economy such as the Netherlands. Think, for example, about recent discussions on reshoring and the impact of globalization on wage inequality and unemployment. The course will focus on four main areas of research in which transaction costs are dominant, viz. (i) international trade with a focus on the multiple dimensions of transaction costs distinguishing between transport costs, institutional costs and cultural costs of exchange, (ii) foreign direct investments with a focus on outsourcing and the organization of the firm in a globalizing world, (iii) industrial organization with a focus on the determinants of the boundaries of the firm, and (iv) networks with a focus on the role of social and regional networks, and on standards as institutionalized settings that facilitate exchange of goods, ideas, etc."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nInteractive lectures."", ""Method of Assessment\nIndividual paper and presentation, and optional assignments."", ""Literature\nAn extensive reading list is made available at the start of the course."", ""Additional Information Target Audience\nSecond and third year participants in the honours program."", ""Custom Course Registration\nSBE rules and dates apply for this SBE HP course."", ""Recommended background knowledge\nBasic familiarity with the principles of economics and statistics.""]"
