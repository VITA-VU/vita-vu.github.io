We start out with studying the language acquisition processes young children go through. We will focus on the developmental processes in sound, word and sentence acquisition. We will also pay some attention to language disorders, such as developmental disorders and aphasia. Taking language acquisition as a starting point, we will then study the systems for sound production, word formation and sentence construction as universal properties of languages. In our phonetics and phonology classes we will study how sounds are pronounced and perceived and how meaning is mapped onto sounds in different languages. We then move on to how words and sentences are formed in a number of languages and how this helps us categorize languages into families (topics: morphology and syntax). In the fourth week, we focus on how languages change from generation to generation and how language contact causes regional language change. In these first four weeks we will study language examples from English and Dutch but also from typologically completely different languages such as Austronesian languages and Amazonian languages. In week five, we will focus less on the language system itself and more on language use. We will study semantics (the mapping of meaning onto words or clauses) and pragmatics (the unwritten rules of language use). In the final week, we will focus on computational linguistics and we will study how computers learn and use language and how this differs from the way humans learn and use language.

Students will also be able to perform basic linguistic analyses on language datasets from languages they do not speak.","In this course, we will study the basics of linguistics and applied linguistics. We start out with studying the language acquisition processes young children go through. We will focus on the developmental processes in sound, word and sentence acquisition. We will also pay some attention to language disorders, such as developmental disorders and aphasia. Taking language acquisition as a starting point, we will then study the systems for sound production, word formation and sentence construction as universal properties of languages. In our phonetics and phonology classes we will study how sounds are pronounced and perceived and how meaning is mapped onto sounds in different languages. We then move on to how words and sentences are formed in a number of languages and how this helps us categorize languages into families (topics: morphology and syntax). In the fourth week, we focus on how languages change from generation to generation and how language contact causes regional language change. In these first four weeks we will study language examples from English and Dutch but also from typologically completely different languages such as Austronesian languages and Amazonian languages. In week five, we will focus less on the language system itself and more on language use. We will study semantics (the mapping of meaning onto words or clauses) and pragmatics (the unwritten rules of language use). In the final week, we will focus on computational linguistics and we will study how computers learn and use language and how this differs from the way humans learn and use language. At the end of the course, students will have become acquainted with an enormous number of fascinating features of language systems and language use.","Lectures (4 hrs per week) and seminars (2 hrs per week).

Poy López,"Seminar*, Lecture",,"[""Course Objective\nDuring the course, students acquire skills and study habits that are essential for analysing academic literature and primary sources, and for writing academic papers. Students also deepen their knowledge on the historiography of an specific historical topic, resulting in the writing of a historiographical essay or “status quaestionis”.\nUpon completion of the course, students will be able to:\nUnderstand the difference between primary and secondary sources\nFind, select, and assess scientific literature\nCritically use reference works and online resources\nAnalyze and summarize scientific literature\nRecognize several approaches and points of view within an academic debate\nFormulate a hypothesis, identify a problem, and elaborate on these by using smaller sub-questions\nUnderstand scholarly rules for annotation and bibliography\nProcess feedback (given by teachers and fellow students)\nCarry out self-evaluation and peer evaluation\nWrite a status quaestionis in which they analyse scientific literature"", ""Course Content\nDuring your studies, you will conduct independent research based on scientific literature and primary sources from the past. You will also present the results of your research to others in an accessible and understandable manner, by writing essays and a thesis. A crucial first step in this process is to be able to describe clearly and accurately what scholars before you have written about the subject, and what questions remain unanswered. This is called the ‘status quaestionis’. During this course, you will acquire the necessary skills to write a good status quaestionis with proper annotations, which results in a relevant research question.\nA first skill implies gathering and evaluating scientific information. You will be introduced to the organization and facilities of the VU’s library (UBVU). You will also be acquainted with the conventions on describing and registering bibliographical data in footnotes and bibliographies. Additionally, we will discuss digital forms of information gathering, such as the use of online catalogues, (academic) search engines, and bibliographical reference works.\nThe ability to make a critical assessment of information is a crucial skill for historians. Anyone conducting research for an essay, course assignment, or thesis, will be constantly confronted with a myriad of facts, knowledge, and interpretations. The value of those is not inherently established.

Students also deepen their knowledge on the historiography of an specific historical topic, resulting in the writing of a historiographical essay or “status quaestionis”.
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:
Understand the difference between primary and secondary sources
Find, select, and assess scientific literature
Critically use reference works and online resources
Analyze and summarize scientific literature
Recognize several approaches and points of view within an academic debate
Formulate a hypothesis, identify a problem, and elaborate on these by using smaller sub-questions
Understand scholarly rules for annotation and bibliography
Process feedback (given by teachers and fellow students)
Carry out self-evaluation and peer evaluation
Write a status quaestionis in which they analyse scientific literature","During your studies, you will conduct independent research based on scientific literature and primary sources from the past. You will also present the results of your research to others in an accessible and understandable manner, by writing essays and a thesis. A crucial first step in this process is to be able to describe clearly and accurately what scholars before you have written about the subject, and what questions remain unanswered. This is called the ‘status quaestionis’. During this course, you will acquire the necessary skills to write a good status quaestionis with proper annotations, which results in a relevant research question.
A first skill implies gathering and evaluating scientific information. You will be introduced to the organization and facilities of the VU’s library (UBVU). You will also be acquainted with the conventions on describing and registering bibliographical data in footnotes and bibliographies. Additionally, we will discuss digital forms of information gathering, such as the use of online catalogues, (academic) search engines, and bibliographical reference works.
The ability to make a critical assessment of information is a crucial skill for historians. Anyone conducting research for an essay, course assignment, or thesis, will be constantly confronted with a myriad of facts, knowledge, and interpretations. The value of those is not inherently established. In ‘Academic Skills for Historians’, you will learn how to assess the reliability and partiality of information.
A second crucial academic ability is the processing and interpreting of information. How do you summarize a scientific article or an academic debate? How do you distinguish between a well-founded and an unsubstantiated opinion? What is the research question put forward in a scholarly article and how does it relate to broader issues?

Students will understand, interpret and explain literary and critical texts from diverse national, cultural, and historical backgrounds.
Students will be able to apply their knowledge to a variety of literary texts and present their research findings both in writing and verbally.
Students will analyse and break down complex texts and debates to understand their components and relationships.
Students will be able to evaluate, assess and critique literary works and peer feedback, providing constructive criticism.
Students will creatively produce original research and presentations, synthesising their understanding and analysis of the texts.","For centuries, literary and other cultural texts have changed the way people think and look at the world. They reveal social injustices and societal ills, offering ideas and ammunition for social change, thereby helping people to imagine different, better realities. A single text may trigger an individual’s struggle for emancipation, but also that of a group or a nation. This course will explore the important ways in which literary texts have contributed to societal change and have liberated people throughout the centuries up to the present.
The texts we discuss have instigated individual readers as well as collectivities to discover and become aware of injustices, unfairness and abuse. This course analyzes that process, using the following questions as leading threads in the discussions: Which rhetorical strategies employed in the texts evoke the readers’ empathy and possible agency? How do the texts simultaneously assist in emboldening the reader, strengthening an emerging community, and gaining acceptance from a wider audience? In which way do they balance realities that are already being lived and imagined possibilities that have yet to materialize? How do they interact with other expressions of the struggle for emancipation, by way of imitation, opposition, appropriation? And, finally, how do they function within the communities that they have helped found, how are they remembered, recreated, redefined, and to which purposes?","Students and instructor meet three times per week: Lectures, 1 x 2 hours per week.
