Je verdiept je in een door de docent aangereikt historiografisch thema en schrijft daarover een status quaestionis : wat is er al over dit onderwerp geschreven door andere onderzoekers? In hoeverre zijn zij het met elkaar eens, of staan zij tegenover elkaar? Welke tegenstrijdigheden, lacunes of uitdagingen zijn er? Welke nieuwe invalshoeken, methoden of technieken zouden het onderzoek in een andere richting kunnen sturen? Anders dan bij een regulier werkstuk is je eigen onderzoeksvraag niet het begin, maar het sluitstuk van de status quaestionis. Je gaat dus geen onderzoek doen om een vooraf gestelde vraag te beantwoorden, maar je gaat onderzoeken welke vraag er nog gesteld zou moeten worden.\nOm te beginnen leer je hoe je wetenschappelijke informatie moet zoeken en beoordelen.\nJe wordt vertrouwd gemaakt met de inrichting en organisatie van de bibliotheek van de VU (UBVU), en met de conventies rond het beschrijven en opslaan van bibliografische gegevens in voetnoten en literatuurlijsten. Vervolgens komen allerlei elektronische vormen van informatievergaring aan de orde: het gebruik van online catalogi, zoekmachines en bibliografische naslagwerken. Het kritisch beoordelen van informatie is een belangrijke vaardigheid van de historicus. Wie in het kader van een werkstuk, collegeopdracht of scriptie onderzoek doet, wordt voortdurend geconfronteerd met allerlei soorten feiten, kennis en interpretaties waarvan de waarde niet op voorhand vaststaat. In de cursus AcVa leer je de betrouwbaarheid en partijdigheid van informatie beoordelen.\nEen tweede belangrijke academische vaardigheid is het verwerken en interpreteren van informatie: hoe vat je een wetenschappelijk artikel en een wetenschappelijk debat goed samen? Hoe maak je een onderscheid tussen gefundeerde argumenten en goedkope meningen? Wat is de probleemstelling van een artikel en wordt die afdoende beantwoord? Welke benadering is daarvoor gekozen en welke bronnen heeft de auteur gebruikt? Hoe is die keuze verantwoord?\nVervolgens schrijf je stap voor stap een status quaestionis, een samenvatting van de bestaande kennis over een thema, die uitmondt in een eigen onderzoeksvraag. Aan de hand van praktische oefeningen komen alle aspecten van het schrijfproces aan de orde, vanaf het eerste idee tot de laatste tekstrevisie. Daarbij leer je over een goede probleemstelling, aanpak, structuur en stijl. Er wordt in het bijzonder aandacht geschonken aan verantwoord citeren, parafraseren, het vermelden van je bronnen, en het omgaan met AI.

een realistische inschatting maken van het eigen functioneren (zelf-evaluatie)","Tijdens de cursus Academische Vaardigheden (AcVa) leer je een vaardigheid aan die aan de basis ligt van elk historische onderzoek: goed in kaart brengen wat de stand van het onderzoek is op een bepaald terrein. Je verdiept je in een door de docent aangereikt historiografisch thema en schrijft daarover een status quaestionis : wat is er al over dit onderwerp geschreven door andere onderzoekers? In hoeverre zijn zij het met elkaar eens, of staan zij tegenover elkaar? Welke tegenstrijdigheden, lacunes of uitdagingen zijn er? Welke nieuwe invalshoeken, methoden of technieken zouden het onderzoek in een andere richting kunnen sturen? Anders dan bij een regulier werkstuk is je eigen onderzoeksvraag niet het begin, maar het sluitstuk van de status quaestionis. Je gaat dus geen onderzoek doen om een vooraf gestelde vraag te beantwoorden, maar je gaat onderzoeken welke vraag er nog gesteld zou moeten worden.
Om te beginnen leer je hoe je wetenschappelijke informatie moet zoeken en beoordelen.
Je wordt vertrouwd gemaakt met de inrichting en organisatie van de bibliotheek van de VU (UBVU), en met de conventies rond het beschrijven en opslaan van bibliografische gegevens in voetnoten en literatuurlijsten. Vervolgens komen allerlei elektronische vormen van informatievergaring aan de orde: het gebruik van online catalogi, zoekmachines en bibliografische naslagwerken. Het kritisch beoordelen van informatie is een belangrijke vaardigheid van de historicus. Wie in het kader van een werkstuk, collegeopdracht of scriptie onderzoek doet, wordt voortdurend geconfronteerd met allerlei soorten feiten, kennis en interpretaties waarvan de waarde niet op voorhand vaststaat. In de cursus AcVa leer je de betrouwbaarheid en partijdigheid van informatie beoordelen.
Een tweede belangrijke academische vaardigheid is het verwerken en interpreteren van informatie: hoe vat je een wetenschappelijk artikel en een wetenschappelijk debat goed samen? Hoe maak je een onderscheid tussen gefundeerde argumenten en goedkope meningen? Wat is de probleemstelling van een artikel en wordt die afdoende beantwoord? Welke benadering is daarvoor gekozen en welke bronnen heeft de auteur gebruikt? Hoe is die keuze verantwoord?
Vervolgens schrijf je stap voor stap een status quaestionis, een samenvatting van de bestaande kennis over een thema, die uitmondt in een eigen onderzoeksvraag. Aan de hand van praktische oefeningen komen alle aspecten van het schrijfproces aan de orde, vanaf het eerste idee tot de laatste tekstrevisie. Daarbij leer je over een goede probleemstelling, aanpak, structuur en stijl. Er wordt in het bijzonder aandacht geschonken aan verantwoord citeren, parafraseren, het vermelden van je bronnen, en het omgaan met AI. Het verwerken van feedback en het beoordelen van je eigen vorderingen en die van je medestudenten is een belangrijk onderdeel van het leerproces.","Per week 2 uur werkcollege en 2 uur practicum. Wie een college niet kan bijwonen, moet dat van tevoren aan de coördinator laten weten.
Indien meer dan twee bijeenkomsten/opdrachten zonder geldige reden gemist zijn, volgt uitsluiting van het college.","Er is een reeks verplichte opdrachten waar je feedback op krijgt van de docent en je medestudenten (formatief), en een eindopdracht (de status quaestionis), die beoordeeld wordt met een voldoende of onvoldoende (summatief). De deelopdrachten moeten zijn ingeleverd en de eindopdracht moet met een voldoende worden afgerond om het vak te halen.","Jeannette Kamp, Susan Legêne, Matthias van Rossum, Sebas Rümke, Geschiedenis schrijven!

The course consists of six modules:
The basics: data types, operators, type conversions, expressions, statements, if, switch, loops
Vectors, user-defined functions with parameter passing, scopes
Error handling, exceptions, streams and input errors, file IO, command line parameters, assertions and unit testing
Recursion: functions that call themselves, understanding how functions work
Classes: DIY data types, interfaces and implementation, constructors and initialisation
Memory management: pointers, dynamic memory allocation, memory leaks; Tree data structures as recursive data types
The six modules build on top of each other. Students reach the course objectives by mastering the higher-level modules five and six.","This course revolves around self-study with the interactive course e-book, in combination with class sessions for deepening understanding (2 times per week), and practical programming assignments (individual preparation and guided lab sessions 3 times per week).","Throughout the course, the practical programming assignments assess the student's learning progress. Each week, students submit a short self-reflection about how they have solved their homework assignment (or why they failed solving it), and compare their own solution to the ones of up to three other students.
The midterm exam assesses proficiency with modules one, two and three. The final exam assesses proficiency with all six modules. Both exams are computer-based and focus on programming assignments. There will be a resit exam, covering all six modules.
The midterm exam and the final exam together result in the exam grade. Here, the midterm counts for 30% and the final exam for 70%. If taken, the resit exam replaces the combined exam grade from midterm and final.
For passing the course, the exam grade must be at least 5.5. Students with an exam grade of 5.5 or better can raise their total grade by up to 2 grades by earning bonus points (up to 1 for reflection assignments, up to 0.5 for challenge assignments, and up to 0.5 for timely completion of the exercises in the interactive e-book).
