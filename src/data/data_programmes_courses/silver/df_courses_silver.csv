It focuses on the reconstruction of the environment in its broadest sense (landscape, flora, fauna and climate), and the changes therein and it uses the abiotic and biotic components found in geological sediments, soils and archaeological deposits as its source material. While the focus is on the relationship between human settlement and its environment, environmental archaeology always puts man as centre stage: it studies how the physical landscape put limits and constraints on human settlement, and, vice versa, how the natural environment was changed by human intervention and exploitation for food and natural sources. In this course you will be introduced to the methods and theories used in this field of archaeology and learn how to put them to use to answer questions on the interrelationship between humans and their environment.\nIn this course, four aspects of the interrelationship between humans and their environment will be discussed:\nNatural and human-induced processes in the formation of the landscape;\nSpatial imaging of the landscape: the use of maps;\nPlants and animals in the landscape and their exploitation;\nHumans in the landscape: environmental reconstruction and food economy."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nThere will be 2 x 3 contact hours each week.

Can explain geological and soil science processes which are formative to the physical landscape and to distinguish between natural and human causes of these changes
Are able to describe how different food economies are distinguished in archaeology and how those economies have affected the landscape
Are able to interpret sources, methods and techniques used by ecological archaeology to recognize the most important physical characteristics of animal and plant remains.","Environmental Archaeology studies the interaction between humans and their environment in the past. It focuses on the reconstruction of the environment in its broadest sense (landscape, flora, fauna and climate), and the changes therein and it uses the abiotic and biotic components found in geological sediments, soils and archaeological deposits as its source material. While the focus is on the relationship between human settlement and its environment, environmental archaeology always puts man as centre stage: it studies how the physical landscape put limits and constraints on human settlement, and, vice versa, how the natural environment was changed by human intervention and exploitation for food and natural sources. In this course you will be introduced to the methods and theories used in this field of archaeology and learn how to put them to use to answer questions on the interrelationship between humans and their environment.
In this course, four aspects of the interrelationship between humans and their environment will be discussed:
Natural and human-induced processes in the formation of the landscape;
Spatial imaging of the landscape: the use of maps;
Plants and animals in the landscape and their exploitation;
Humans in the landscape: environmental reconstruction and food economy.","There will be 2 x 3 contact hours each week. Most of the classes have a practical component, for which attendance is mandatory.
Classes consist of interactive lectures which introduce the course topics, and practicals which are aimed at:
training you to use maps (topographic, soil, geomorphological, and archaeological prospection maps);
offering you a first introduction to the determination of ecological remains (analysis of plants and bones);
presenting a short natural landscape reference paper","The students will be assessed by presentations (20%), contributions to practical assessments (AVV/NAV), and map exercises (20%). A final exam will conclude the course (60%).

One of the most important topics, which currently is included only implicitly in the study programme, is the research process---the philosophy, theories, methods, and body of knowledge associated with the scientific method of our field.
This course aims to introduce the principles and practice of the research process in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.","Lectures with Socratic engagement in online sessions, self-study and
self-reflection, guided report-writing. There are 16 sessions spread
over the entire academic year, with about 2x meetings per month. Exact
timings to be announced at the start of the course.
Students and course professors meet at mid-term to discuss progress and
draft of the research portfolio.
Students and course professors meet at the end, for a one-day seminar
where all students present and discuss the research process.","Students formulate one research proposal, preferably linked with the HP research project. The formulation delivers one report, for which we offer a template students can use.
Students formulate a research portfolio, by self-reflecting on the main topics of the course. The portfolio must cover at least 60% of the topics, each addressed in a short overview (suggested: 1-page recto and verso).
Students formulate a final report, which also includes the preliminary reports from points 1 and 2. This report is due at the end of thecourse. The portfolio should be delivered at mid-term (the first part, for feedback) and at the end (the final version).
Students prepare a presentation of their research proposal and final report.
Relatively to point 1, which presents the start of the research project, this report also includes a reflection on the entire duration and final results of the research project. Relatively to point 2, this report also includes an analysis and self-reflection about how the entire course helped with the research project. The final report cannot add more than 6 pages of new material, excluding references and the title page.
Mandatory parts:
Students have to complete the detailed requirements for each of the assessment points 1, 2, and 3.
All assignments, as well as the course, are graded as pass or fail.","No textbook. The course provides: slide decks via Canvas. There is a list of recommended readings, including several books.",This course is only open for students enrolled in the BSc Honours Programme AI/CS of the Beta Faculty.,

You design strategies on how you are going to test the idea. Through this process you gain insight into how a particular technological innovation or the application of innovative knowledge from a specific fundamental research domain in your disciplinary field of research creates commercial and societal value.","Lectures, pitching, group work.",Individual and group assignments,"Blankesteijn, M., et al.

put a rigorous foundation to the completeness of real numbers via the notion of supremum of a set;
phrase the concept of sequential and functional limits in the challenge-response framework and use it to prove the fundamental convergence theorems of R and to compute concrete limits;
apply the theory of convergence to series of real numbers and to the Banach contraction theorem on the real line;
determine if a subset of R is closed or open and construct new open and closed sets starting from known ones;
classify real functions according to their regularity (continuous, differentiable, Riemann-integrable), and employ their fundamental theorems in examples;
compute the pointwise and uniform limit of sequences and series of functions and determine when the limit process preserves the regularity;
generalize the convergence and topological properties acquired in the first part of the course from R to metric spaces and in particular to the space of continuous functions on an interval;
formulate an abstract mathematical argument in a rigorous way paying attention to the role of the hypotheses and to possible examples and counterexamples.","This course treats the rigorous mathematical theory behind single-variable Calculus:
completeness of R, limits, continuity, differentiability, integrability, and the mutual relation between these concepts. The mathematical theory is presented in such a way that everything can later be generalised to the context of metric spaces. The space C^0[a,b] of real-valued continuous functions on an interval [a,b] will appear as the main example of such metric spaces for which the theory can be applied to solve differential equations via the Banach contraction principle.
Topics:
Suprema, infima and completeness of real numbers;
Limit of real sequences;
The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and the Cauchy Criterion;
Applications of convergence to infinite series and to the Banach contraction principle;
Basic topology of R
Functional limits and (uniform) continuity;
Differentiable functions: linear approximation and the Mean Value Theorems;
The Riemann integral: construction, properties and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Pointwise and uniform convergence of sequences of functions
Metric spaces: basic topology, completeness and the Banach contraction principle
Application to the space C^0[a,b] with the uniform distance: the Picard-Lindelöf Theorem on differential equations.","Lectures, study sessions and tutorials (2+1+2 hours per week).

To apply key concepts and findings in analyses of communication across diverse settings, modalities, and media;
To translate key concepts into research by performing small-scale analyses.","In this course, the role of culture in both online communication and offline communication is examined. Much of what people do, say, think, and prefer is influenced by culture. This relationship is evident in cultural stereotypes, pop culture, verbal communication, non-verbal communication, online discourse, and so on. Drawing inspirations from everyday examples, we will identify common communication patterns, which will be analysed based on prominent theories in cross-cultural communication and discourse analysis.

But in all of these member states, other languages besides the official language are spoken as well, some with an official status as regional languages or heritage languages, some without. Recently, new languages have entered the EU as a result of migration. The EU is thus home to speakers of hundreds of languages who not only have to co-exist and communicate with each other but also need access to resources and services. We will study the various domains in which this multilingual communication takes place and the different views that EU countries have on the position of these languages. Core concepts include majority/minority languages and official/non-official languages, and the consequences that these definitions have on the personal and professional lives of their speakers. We will also consider issues related to equality and linguistic justice and think critically about complex societal issues concerning the management of linguistic diversity in the EU.",Weekly lectures and seminars,"Written exam (80% of final grade): fulfilling learning goals 1-4

To apply learned knowledge to well-reasoned assessment of communication messages.","Images are becoming more and more important in communication messages. Dependent on communicative goals, both the design and function of images in documents may differ. In three themes we will consider how images are processed differently by viewers due to other functions they serve. We will look at visual metaphors in advertising and their persuasive function. We will also study the how visual and verbal content comes together in learning contexts. In both cases, the interplay of images with text plays a pivotal role. Theories of information processing will be studied and applied to analyze the role of images in documents and the intended and unintended effects they may have on document users.",One lecture and one seminar a week (two hours each).

Concreet betekent dit het volgende:
Je kunt de eigenschappen van geslaagde audiovisuele journalistieke producties (zowel wat betreft vorm als inhoud) beschrijven en deze kennis inzetten bij de productie van eigen werk en de evaluatie van dat van anderen (theorie- en praktijkopdrachten);
Je kunt de wetenschappelijke theorieën die aan de orde zijn geweest toepassen op en productief maken voor de journalistieke praktijk (theorie- en praktijkopdrachten);
Je kunt beelden analyseren en uitleggen hoe deze betekenis genereren (theorieopdrachten);
Je kunt kritisch reflecteren op je eigen werk, dat van anderen en de wetenschappelijke theorieën die aan de orde komen (theorie- en praktijkopdrachten).","In dit vak staat de audiovisuele journalistiek centraal. Je leert basisvaardigheden zoals beeldmateriaal verzamelen, interviewen voor videoproducties en items monteren. Journalistiek denken en werken staan hierbij voorop. Hoe kom ik aan nieuws? Welke bronnen heb ik nodig om mijn verhaal te kunnen vertellen en hoe verhoud ik me tot hen? Hoe kan ik mijn kijkers boeien?
Daarnaast maak je kennis met de wetenschappelijke literatuur op het gebied van de audiovisuele journalistiek. Zo wordt duidelijk hoe kijkers betekenis toekennen aan beeldmateriaal, welke mechanismen aan de constructie van audiovisueel nieuws ten grondslag liggen, welke keuzemogelijkheden journalisten hebben bij het maken van het nieuws en het beeld dat zij daarmee creëren van de werkelijkheid. Je maakt dus een verbinding tussen theorie en praktijk. Aan de hand van je praktische ervaring kun je de theorie op waarde schatten. Andersom helpt je kennis van de wetenschappelijke literatuur je een betere videojournalist te worden.
De journalistieke eindproducten worden gemaakt voor lokale en/of regionale media. Je maakt je items dus voor een bestaand publiek. Lokale journalistiek helpt burgers hun directe omgeving en elkaar beter te begrijpen; daarom speelt deze vorm van journalistiek een belangrijke rol in een democratische samenleving. Bovendien oefen je zo vaardigheden die je nodig hebt om in nationale en internationale media aan de slag te kunnen.","Hoorcollege, een practicum filmen en monteren en een werkcollege per week. Houd rekening met extra gastcolleges.","Het eindcijfer is gebaseerd op de resultaten voor twee toetsingsonderdelen:
Theorieopdrachten (verslagen en presentaties): groepswerk 40% van het eindcijfer.
Praktijkopdrachten (journalistieke video-items): groepswerk 60% van het eindcijfer.
Voor elk van de toetsingsonderdelen dient minimaal een voldoende te worden behaald.
Toelichting toetsingsonderdelen:
In de theorieopdrachten verbind je de theorie met de praktijk. Aan de hand van wetenschappelijke literatuur en de collegestof analyseer je individueel én als redactiegroep beelden uit de journalistieke praktijk. In de werkcolleges presenteer je de bevindingen. De vier theorieopdrachten spitsen zich toe op:
Beeld
Interview
Montage beeld/geluid
Beeldvorming
De praktijkopdrachten bestaan uit vier journalistieke video-items. In de practica leer je filmen met je smartphone en monteren met Adobe Premiere Pro.
De video-items maak je als redactiegroep van max vier studenten. Je verricht hiervoor research, gaat op pad, houdt interviews en monteert. Je kiest zelf het onderwerp voor de video’s:
Interview
Nieuwsitem
Reportage
Achtergrondverhaal
Tijdens de bijeenkomsten en daarbuiten werk je intensief met je redactiegroep. Je bent voortdurend met elkaar in gesprek en geeft peerfeedback. De mate van participatie en de kwaliteit van ieders bijdragen is daarbij belangrijk.
Voor elke opdracht (van de theorie- en de praktijkopdrachten) moet minimaal een voldoende zijn behaald om het vak te kunnen afronden.","Onder meer:

Je bent in staat om een eigen normatieve visie te ontwikkelen op jouw vak (journalistiek, mediaprofessional, communicatieprofessional) en op actuele ontwikkelingen daarbinnen.
Je weet in actuele situaties een gearticuleerd standpunt in te nemen,daarbij verwijzend naar kernwaarden die voor jouw vak belangrijk zijn. Je weet hoe je een betoog moet opbouwen en hoe je je eigen standpunt, met steekhoudende argumenten, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk, kunt verdedigen.","Een professie is meer dan een set van vaardigheden of het opvolgen van een aantal vuistregels. Het belichaamt ook een sociale praktijk waarin specifieke waarden gerealiseerd worden. Wil je straks als journalist, mediaprofessional of communicatieprofessional goed kunnen functioneren en zelfstandig een positie kunnen innemen, dan zul je je bewust moeten zijn welke waarden binnen jouw vak belangrijk zijn en hoe je tussen verschillende paradigma’s kunt switchen. Daarom is het belangrijk dat je leert reflecteren op de kernwaarden die in jouw vak centraal staan, en ook op de vraag welke rol deze waarden nog hebben in een medialandschap dat o.a. door digitalisering en politieke ontwikkelingen zo ingrijpend is veranderd. In dit vak leer je welke rol je als professional in het publieke debat inneemt en welke verschillende kernwaarden daaraan ten grondslag liggen. Ook leer je zelfstandig een visie op je vak te ontwikkelen en deze visie met argumenten te onderbouwen. Je leert met andere woorden wat het betekent om verantwoordelijkheid te nemen voor je professionele handelen.","In totaal acht uur college per week, verdeeld over hoor- en werkcolleges.

T. Krennmayr,Seminar,Communication and Information Studies,"[""Course Objective\nIn this course, you will learn how to discuss current research on metaphor in different professional settings (such as e.g. health and education) in a critical and constructive fashion; you will learn how to analyze metaphorical language and its different manifestations and functions; you will apply different tools for metaphor analysis; and in the process, you will improve your skills in written and oral presentation in English.\nObjectives\nYou can identify, classify, and analyze metaphors, in different types of ‘real-world’ discourse taken from a range of professional settings, including their functions in a given discourse context.\nYou can apply different research methods to investigate metaphors on both a linguistic and conceptual level.\nYou understand how metaphors/metaphorical frames can influence how we think, write, talk, and act.\nYou understand how metaphor functions as a powerful device in different professional contexts (e.g. education, health, politics, or the courtroom) and you examine its role in e.g. talking about complex or difficult topics, framing identity and personal experience, shaping public opinion, or reinforcing societal structures.\nYou can summarize key topics of state-of-the-art research in the field and can critically evaluate research articles in the field.\nYou can set up and carry out a small-scale study on metaphor in a professional setting of your own choice.\nYou are able to present ideas in both oral and written mode."", ""Course Content\nCourse content: A metaphor is a figure of speech in which we conceive of an item from one (target) domain in terms of an item from another (source) domain. We know metaphor from literary texts, like Shakespeare’s sonnets (‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?), but metaphors are also crucial beyond literature. We use them as the major device to make sense of complex or abstract phenomena and to convey our everyday conceptual and emotional experiences. Most of us are unaware of the way our language system is filled with metaphorically used words (think about verbs and prepositions). At the same time, in many disciplines metaphor is used more deliberately for rhetorical or instructional purposes.

Objectives
You can identify, classify, and analyze metaphors, in different types of ‘real-world’ discourse taken from a range of professional settings, including their functions in a given discourse context.
You can apply different research methods to investigate metaphors on both a linguistic and conceptual level.
You understand how metaphors/metaphorical frames can influence how we think, write, talk, and act.
You understand how metaphor functions as a powerful device in different professional contexts (e.g. education, health, politics, or the courtroom) and you examine its role in e.g. talking about complex or difficult topics, framing identity and personal experience, shaping public opinion, or reinforcing societal structures.
You can summarize key topics of state-of-the-art research in the field and can critically evaluate research articles in the field.
You can set up and carry out a small-scale study on metaphor in a professional setting of your own choice.
You are able to present ideas in both oral and written mode.","Course content: A metaphor is a figure of speech in which we conceive of an item from one (target) domain in terms of an item from another (source) domain. We know metaphor from literary texts, like Shakespeare’s sonnets (‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?), but metaphors are also crucial beyond literature. We use them as the major device to make sense of complex or abstract phenomena and to convey our everyday conceptual and emotional experiences. Most of us are unaware of the way our language system is filled with metaphorically used words (think about verbs and prepositions). At the same time, in many disciplines metaphor is used more deliberately for rhetorical or instructional purposes. For example, politicians talk about ‘going to war against’ the Corona epidemic; epidemiologists have framed it as a disaster (‘your house is on fire’) and its spread has been described as a ‘domino-effect’. Metaphorical language has the power to illuminate, but also to obscure a topic; it has the power to change the way we view the world.
In this course, we will explore the use of metaphorical language and the different functions it has (e.g. to transfer knowledge, to create identity, to frame and envisage other realities) in different professional settings, such as health care (and illnesses), the courtroom, or education.

It entails a tutored research project at one of the research groups at SBE, which may be part of a larger research project/program of the group in which the student participates or may be set up as a separate project specifically for the RA-ship. Two general formats can be chosen to set up the RA-ship:\nas an independent component of the honours program (6 credits),\na study combined with the BSc thesis, which allows to develop a research project of larger scale and/or scope (12 + 6 credits). The output of the RA must be identifiable (as a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis.\nThe RA allows students to build on their skills developed during the programme and, if combined with the BSc thesis, to extend this into a more complete research experience.\nResearch should be considered in a broad sense, and can involve different stages of research and different research methods. Although typically the RA will include an empirical research component, it may also involve extended literature research. Naturally, this should be reflected in the project design. The form of the RA that is chosen is an important determinant of the expected output and criteria used for evaluation of the process and output. Option 2 seems the ideal way to combine the regular BSc thesis work with a more in-depth empirical study than is usually the case for the thesis.\nIn case of option 1 described above, expectations about output of the project need to be in line with the credits (6 EC) that are available for the RA-ship. When option 2 is chosen, the output of the RA can be integrated into the BSc thesis, which results in a significant increase in expected output. However, the output of the RA must be identifiable (f.e. a separate section or appendix) and is graded separately from the thesis. Note that the scope of the RA-ship, expected output and evaluation should be proportional with the weights of the two components in the programme (i.e. 6 + 12 EC).\nKey for the evaluation of the RA is the provision of an independent piece of research output either in the form of a research paper, or an identifiable part of the thesis (f.e. an extra chapter or appendix). The quality of the paper should be such that it can be graded and preferably be submitted to an academic conference or perhaps even to an academic journal. This paper can be complemented with other relevant project output as part of the evaluation such as databases, measurement instruments and a reference list. These elements may also be part of the evaluation and grading of the project. Evaluation of the RA is context dependent, since this depends on the nature of the research and the tasks conducted by the RA.\nGeneral guidelines for evaluation and grading can, however, be provided and include the following aspects:\nQuality, originality and relevance of the research question (or of extensions/refinement of existing questions developed by the student);\nTheory development;\nExtent and quality of data collection and analysis;\nDescription of findings and results;\nDevelopment and discussion of inferences and conclusions;\nIndependence (e.g. in formulating/developing/extending research questions, theory development, data collection and analysis and drawing of inferences);\nOverall quality of the research report (quality of writing, appearance etc.).\nNot all elements may be equally important for each RA-ship, and weights should be determined in accordance with the nature of the project. When the RA is combined with the bachelor thesis, supervisors are recommended to take these criteria in conjunction with the evaluation checklist for the thesis. In this case, the thesis and RA can be evaluated and graded as if they are one study component, even though this grade will be registered separately for the two components.\nThe possibility to engage in an RA and to gain hands-on experience in conducting research is dependent on the availability of qualified researchers and projects within the different research groups. Interested honours students are advised to actively explore possibilities through their contacts with School members in the BSc and honours programme, and with their mentor in the honours programme. Research projects will usually be formulated close to ongoing research projects at the department or research group, and depending on students’ interests, they can apply at the appropriate research group and supervisor.\nResearch-assistantships can start any time during the academic year, although students are recommended to engage in an RA after, and not before having completed their advanced methods course in the bachelor program.

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application). In doing so, you practice skills such as abstraction and reasoning (Academic and Research Skills).\nAfter following this course you can:\ndescribe and explain the typical features of the regulatory framework of financial reporting in developed economies;\ndescribe common accounting practices for a selection of common transactions and events (e.g. income tax, currency translation, intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries) discussed in this course;\nfor the selected transactions and events: solve a given issue in the form of a motivated choice for a specific accounting treatment, journals entries and/or completed financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement);\nrecognize and explain in a given fragment from published financial statements how an item or transaction has been accounted for, or explain the reporting about such accounting in a news media item;\nuse and interpret selected regulatory texts to answer questions about mandatory or optional accounting and reporting practices."", ""Course Content\nExternal financial reporting in the form of annual or quarterly financial statements is the basis of communication between a company and financial stakeholders such as shareholders and other investors. Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets.

In this course we focus on external financial reporting, in particular by business enterprises. You learn about key issues in financial reporting from the perspective of the reporting company, about the regulatory framework of financial reporting (Bridging theory and Practice - Knowledge). You learn to apply your knowledge to specific issues derived from reporting practice (Bridging Theory and Practice - Application). In doing so, you practice skills such as abstraction and reasoning (Academic and Research Skills).
After following this course you can:
describe and explain the typical features of the regulatory framework of financial reporting in developed economies;
describe common accounting practices for a selection of common transactions and events (e.g. income tax, currency translation, intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries) discussed in this course;
for the selected transactions and events: solve a given issue in the form of a motivated choice for a specific accounting treatment, journals entries and/or completed financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement);
recognize and explain in a given fragment from published financial statements how an item or transaction has been accounted for, or explain the reporting about such accounting in a news media item;
use and interpret selected regulatory texts to answer questions about mandatory or optional accounting and reporting practices.","External financial reporting in the form of annual or quarterly financial statements is the basis of communication between a company and financial stakeholders such as shareholders and other investors. Numbers from the financial statements such as profit, cash flow and sales revenue play an important role in financial markets. However, they also have legal significance, and are important in corporate governance. For larger enterprises, preparing financial statements is a complex process.

This starts naturally with the birth of a startup and the development towards an established business and further growth, stagnation or demise as the business gets older. But the context is also relevant being it a certain industry or a country like Amazon.com in the tech world and an electronics store on a market in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\nThe course is part of the Bachelor Specialisation Entrepreneurship and could lead to a Masters in Business Administration or a Masters in Entrepreneurshop. This shows in the topics covered, the papers used, the guest lectures and the assignments. Essential papers of Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Strategy and Organization are presented within the context of SME's.\nAcademic & research skills:\nargumentation – being able to argue the topics involved.\napplication – applying acquired knowledge to business situations like starting a business\nanalysis – examining and understanding problems from different perspectives\nBridging theory and practice:\nhas fundamental knowledge about the those disciplines relevant to the fields of entrepreneurship, strategy and organization\nhas specialised, in-depth knowledge and insights in the field of business development\nis able to apply theoretical knowledge in a specific business situation\nis encouraged to actively experience the chosen field in real-life during the study\nMany students participating in this course want to start and own a business. Some others want to find out if running a small business is for them, if that is a role they could take. They want to learn what makes a small business work well and what it means for the owner/manager to run a small business. They especially want to know about the factors that make a small business fail or succeed. They also Exchange students sometimes pick this course to learn about business in one period.\nWith regards to theory this course builds upon courses like Organization Theory, International- Strategy, Organisation Behaviour and Human Resource Management. With regards to the research and fieldwork to be done, this course most specifically builds on Business Research Methods I (BK and IBA), Business Research Methods II (BK and IBA) and uses the learnings and experience from the Integrative Research Project (BK and IBA) in the second year. The students will employ previously learned qualitative research skills to research into SME cases and their own startup case."", ""Course Content\nSmall and Medium Sized Entreprises (SME's) are facing tremendous challenges, with the ongoing digitalization and globalization today’s world of business is facing. Next to the distinction in terms of size, SME businesses can also be distinguished on the basis of their qualitative characteristics, such as the crucial role of the owner-manager, the strong local and regional focus and the presence of family in the business.\nTopics covered:\nThe role of small business in the economy is covered. The theory and practice of the startup will also be covered. Aspects of growth and development of small business to larger business will be covered such as planning, organizing, strategizing and leading small organizations. Different aspects of innovation both in theory and practice will be part of the course. Other topics to be covered are strategy, finance and culture in the context of a small business.

How are general trends and specific strategic issues and theories different (or: the same) when it comes to starting, growing and managing small businesses. This starts naturally with the birth of a startup and the development towards an established business and further growth, stagnation or demise as the business gets older. But the context is also relevant being it a certain industry or a country like Amazon.com in the tech world and an electronics store on a market in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
The course is part of the Bachelor Specialisation Entrepreneurship and could lead to a Masters in Business Administration or a Masters in Entrepreneurshop. This shows in the topics covered, the papers used, the guest lectures and the assignments. Essential papers of Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Strategy and Organization are presented within the context of SME's.
Academic & research skills:
argumentation – being able to argue the topics involved.
application – applying acquired knowledge to business situations like starting a business
analysis – examining and understanding problems from different perspectives
Bridging theory and practice:
has fundamental knowledge about the those disciplines relevant to the fields of entrepreneurship, strategy and organization
has specialised, in-depth knowledge and insights in the field of business development
is able to apply theoretical knowledge in a specific business situation
is encouraged to actively experience the chosen field in real-life during the study
Many students participating in this course want to start and own a business. Some others want to find out if running a small business is for them, if that is a role they could take. They want to learn what makes a small business work well and what it means for the owner/manager to run a small business. They especially want to know about the factors that make a small business fail or succeed. They also Exchange students sometimes pick this course to learn about business in one period.
With regards to theory this course builds upon courses like Organization Theory, International- Strategy, Organisation Behaviour and Human Resource Management. With regards to the research and fieldwork to be done, this course most specifically builds on Business Research Methods I (BK and IBA), Business Research Methods II (BK and IBA) and uses the learnings and experience from the Integrative Research Project (BK and IBA) in the second year. The students will employ previously learned qualitative research skills to research into SME cases and their own startup case.","Small and Medium Sized Entreprises (SME's) are facing tremendous challenges, with the ongoing digitalization and globalization today’s world of business is facing. Next to the distinction in terms of size, SME businesses can also be distinguished on the basis of their qualitative characteristics, such as the crucial role of the owner-manager, the strong local and regional focus and the presence of family in the business.
Topics covered:
The role of small business in the economy is covered. The theory and practice of the startup will also be covered. Aspects of growth and development of small business to larger business will be covered such as planning, organizing, strategizing and leading small organizations. Different aspects of innovation both in theory and practice will be part of the course. Other topics to be covered are strategy, finance and culture in the context of a small business. Teaching cases focussing on the different topics mentioned above will be part of the classes. This course offers a balance between theory, research and practice within the frame of small business.",Lectures with a focus on learning to apply the knowledge Instruction Lectures with teaching cases and documentaries Tutorials with a focus on building a business and solving business problems.,"Exam - Individual assessment

I.D. Lindner,"Study Group, Written partial exam, Lecture",,"[""Course Objective\nThe past two decades have seen a growing public and scientific fascination about the complex “connectedness” of modern society and markets. At the heart of this fascination is the idea of a network: the architecture of interconnections. This aspect permeates our social and economic lives in countless ways. Social networks play a central role in the transmission of information, how we vote, how diseases spread, whether we become criminals, what products we buy, which education we choose, and it highly impacts the likelihood of succeeding professionally. Furthermore, agents build their business relationships and networks anticipating the outcomes that result from this interaction. Network aspects also explain why many economic environments of interest are dominated by a few agents, be individuals or firms. Think for example of scientists competing for publicizing their work, pharma firms engaging in R&D for the development of new drugs, or online travel agents trying to attract hotels and travelers to their websites. The choices of these interconnected agents have far-reaching effects not only on prices, quantities, and the direction of innovation, and may cause wide repercussions throughout the economy.\nThe course begins with an empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of the concepts used to describe and measure networks.

At the heart of this fascination is the idea of a network: the architecture of interconnections. This aspect permeates our social and economic lives in countless ways. Social networks play a central role in the transmission of information, how we vote, how diseases spread, whether we become criminals, what products we buy, which education we choose, and it highly impacts the likelihood of succeeding professionally. Furthermore, agents build their business relationships and networks anticipating the outcomes that result from this interaction. Network aspects also explain why many economic environments of interest are dominated by a few agents, be individuals or firms. Think for example of scientists competing for publicizing their work, pharma firms engaging in R&D for the development of new drugs, or online travel agents trying to attract hotels and travelers to their websites. The choices of these interconnected agents have far-reaching effects not only on prices, quantities, and the direction of innovation, and may cause wide repercussions throughout the economy.
The course begins with an empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of the concepts used to describe and measure networks. Next, we cover a set of models about how networks form, including random network models, as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrid models. We then move to a discussion of a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including opinion formation, disease, contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.
Next, keeping an eye on the current pressing problems in business and society, the course centers around strategic behavior in markets and networks, both from the business perspective as well as from the societal viewpoint.

Examples include bank lending, college admissions, and bail decisions in criminal proceedings.\nThough the use of algorithmic decision making is often justified as being \""more objective\"" than human decision making, there are many instances demonstrating that it can produce biased or discriminatory predictions or decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain individuals or groups. Awareness of this issue and knowledge about approaches to address it are of high importance for data scientists and policy makers.\nAnother highly relevant aspect for decision making based on data is the interpretability of the estimation outcomes and decisions obtained using a machine learning method. One possibility is to restrict the class of applied algorithms to interpretable models (e.g. decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression). However, \""black-box\"" methods (e.g. random forests, deep neural networks) have proven to be highly effective in many more complex settings, while not providing a means to understand the sources of a particular prediction or decision. Model-agnostic methods such as partial dependence plots, Local Surrogate models (LIME), and Shapley Values are important concepts enhancing interpretability and allowing for comparisons of any set of machine learning outcomes.\nThe course is divided into two parts. The first part of the course (weeks 1-3) addresses the topic of interpretability in supervised machine learning settings. We will study local and global methods to interpret the outcomes of black-box models and apply them to a range of real-world examples. The second part (weeks 4-6) is concerned with fairness in machine learning.

Furthermore, students know and are able to apply different approaches to interpret the model outcomes of supervised machine learning methods, including both intrinsically interpretable models and model-agnostic methods.","Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to make or improve predictions, which then serve as a basis for decision making. Examples include bank lending, college admissions, and bail decisions in criminal proceedings.
Though the use of algorithmic decision making is often justified as being ""more objective"" than human decision making, there are many instances demonstrating that it can produce biased or discriminatory predictions or decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain individuals or groups. Awareness of this issue and knowledge about approaches to address it are of high importance for data scientists and policy makers.
Another highly relevant aspect for decision making based on data is the interpretability of the estimation outcomes and decisions obtained using a machine learning method. One possibility is to restrict the class of applied algorithms to interpretable models (e.g. decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression). However, ""black-box"" methods (e.g. random forests, deep neural networks) have proven to be highly effective in many more complex settings, while not providing a means to understand the sources of a particular prediction or decision. Model-agnostic methods such as partial dependence plots, Local Surrogate models (LIME), and Shapley Values are important concepts enhancing interpretability and allowing for comparisons of any set of machine learning outcomes.
The course is divided into two parts. The first part of the course (weeks 1-3) addresses the topic of interpretability in supervised machine learning settings. We will study local and global methods to interpret the outcomes of black-box models and apply them to a range of real-world examples. The second part (weeks 4-6) is concerned with fairness in machine learning. We will introduce formal definitions of fairness, analyze real-world data sets, and discuss what algorithmic decision making can and cannot achieve.","4 hours per week of lectures, 2 hours per week of tutorials.","Written exam, group assignment.","Geron (2019), Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

The European economies had barely recovered from the effects of the financial and sovereign debt crises of a decade and a half ago when they got hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Going forward, countries face macroeconomic policy challenges related to the climate transition, geopolitical instability and a spike in inflation. What can be learned from earlier experiences, from cross-country variation in policy response, and from the theoretical and empirical literature on fiscal and monetary policy to guide decision makers? Is further fiscal stimulus needed or wanted going forward? Are current levels of government debt too high to ask for more public investment? How can Central Banks balance their responsibility for price stability and financial stability? What policy makers believe are the answer to these questions will shape their response to the current economic crisis and recovery.\nYou will put yourself in the shoes of a policy consultant who has been asked to advise the European Commission on its coordination and oversight of member state’s macroeconomic policy.

SELF-AWARENESS
describe what you would like to understand better about the effects of macroeconomic policies. Make a presentation at a 'Roundtable' meeting and discuss and reflect on other students' presentations.","We live in uncertain times. The European economies had barely recovered from the effects of the financial and sovereign debt crises of a decade and a half ago when they got hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Going forward, countries face macroeconomic policy challenges related to the climate transition, geopolitical instability and a spike in inflation. What can be learned from earlier experiences, from cross-country variation in policy response, and from the theoretical and empirical literature on fiscal and monetary policy to guide decision makers? Is further fiscal stimulus needed or wanted going forward? Are current levels of government debt too high to ask for more public investment? How can Central Banks balance their responsibility for price stability and financial stability? What policy makers believe are the answer to these questions will shape their response to the current economic crisis and recovery.
You will put yourself in the shoes of a policy consultant who has been asked to advise the European Commission on its coordination and oversight of member state’s macroeconomic policy.

We also discuss the real effective exchange rate, explaining how countries within a single monetary union and, as in the case of EMU, the fact that countries that share a single currency can still have different real exchange rates. The advantages and disadvantages of a monetary union and of other exchange rate regimes are also discussed, in the context of the theory of the optimal currency areas.\nWe also discuss historical systems, such as the Golden Standard and the Bretton Woods System. Naturally, attention is paid to the most important international financial institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB).

English language students should make sure to register in the ENG tutorial group(s).","This course has a Dutch language track and an English language track. This is the outline for the English. Although the topics are the same, their coverage is different.
The principles of legal academic thinking are taught on the basis of literature, case law and statute law. In the course you will among other things learn how to interpret and apply statute law (Academic and research skills). You will acquire knowledge of and insight into national (primarily Dutch) law and international law (mainly EU law) and regulation relevant for economists. The focus is on elements of law that are relevant for doing business. The course starts with an overview of fields of law that are relevant for business activities; after that the focus will be on the company’s participation in legal transactions (Bridging Theory and Practice). This is done by case based learning (Knowledge).
Through tutorial assignments the students learn to apply the knowledge gained in this into practise in a team effort.
After completing this course you:
Will have insight in principles of law, legal systems and the legislative process
Have insight into the structure and scope of EU law and its effects on EU member states
Have insight into civil dispute resolution
Have insight into basic private law issues related to business activities with a focus on business contracts and contracting, [intellectual] property and tort
Will understand the legal structure of companies, the concept of legal personality, capitalisation of a company and principles of labour law and insolvency law and you will be more aware of the legal aspects of many current events",Lectures and Tutorials,"Small team Assignments

These decades witnessed not only dramatic shifts in power and ideology, but also enduring changes in the ways Europeans understood society, identity, and progress.\nRather than following a purely chronological narrative, the course is organized thematically around key developments: the revolutionary legacy and the reconfiguration of political order; the industrial transformation of economies and societies; the making and unmaking of empires at home and abroad; the cultural construction of class, gender, race, and religion; and the increasing tensions between order and upheaval in the lead-up to global war.\nStudents will be encouraged to critically evaluate both contemporary interpretations and retrospective analyses of the nineteenth century, while developing a nuanced understanding of the ways in which this formative period laid the groundwork for modern Europe and and the global forces that shaped its development during this transformative century. Particular emphasis will be placed on these transnational processes and comparative perspectives that challenge conventional national narratives."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nA mixture of lectures and seminars in which key texts will be presented and debated.

Knowledge Recall: Students will be assessed on their ability to accurately recall, contextualize, and explain key events, figures, and concepts—such as the French Revolution, nationalism, industrialization, imperialism—through written exams, quizzes, and structured presentations.
Knowledge Relevance: Students will examine and debate the enduring legacies of modern European history, reflecting on how the long nineteenth century continue to inform present-day European political culture, identities, and institutions through class debates, presentations, and the written examination.","Profound political, social, economic, and cultural transformations reshaped Europe between the French Revolution of 1789 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914—a period often referred to as the “long nineteenth century.” It was an era marked by revolution and reaction, the rise of the nation-state, the spread of liberalism and socialism, the expansion and contestation of empires, and the emergence of modern mass politics and culture. These decades witnessed not only dramatic shifts in power and ideology, but also enduring changes in the ways Europeans understood society, identity, and progress.
Rather than following a purely chronological narrative, the course is organized thematically around key developments: the revolutionary legacy and the reconfiguration of political order; the industrial transformation of economies and societies; the making and unmaking of empires at home and abroad; the cultural construction of class, gender, race, and religion; and the increasing tensions between order and upheaval in the lead-up to global war.
Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate both contemporary interpretations and retrospective analyses of the nineteenth century, while developing a nuanced understanding of the ways in which this formative period laid the groundwork for modern Europe and and the global forces that shaped its development during this transformative century. Particular emphasis will be placed on these transnational processes and comparative perspectives that challenge conventional national narratives.",A mixture of lectures and seminars in which key texts will be presented and debated.

This module utilizes sub-Saharan Africa as a starting point from which to explore the spatial, technological, political and socio-economic location of Africa in global networks since 1800, and demonstrate how this has had an impact on the African condition. It seeks to inculcate a productive understanding of Africa’s place (past and present) in the world. Special attention is given to the dynamics that produced generations of African facilitators, as Joseph Miller has argued, “from the suppliers of slaves through post-colonial “gatekeeping” elites brokering flows of funds and commodities between national economies and international capital, often to their and their clients’ personal advantage.” An understanding of the relationship between sub-Saharan Africa and the world enriches understanding of both global connections and specific regional, sub-regional and local contexts. Crucially, it encourages students to assess how Africans shaped as well as experienced such engagements.","2 Seminars (4 hours per week) plus work in archives, independent and assisted by teachers (scheduled moments)","Participation in class (10%)

Ben je in staat een cultuurhistorische bron of artefact te analyseren in de sociale of politieke context.","Dit vak biedt je zowel een inleiding in de politieke en sociale verhoudingen in Nederland in de periode 1500-1800 als ook in de mogelijkheden van een cultuurhistorische benadering van de geschiedenis. Cultuur en macht zijn nauw met elkaar verbonden. In de eerste vier weken lees je hoe en door wie Nederland werd bestuurd tussen 1500 en 1800. Wie maakte hier de dienst uit en hoe zien we dat terug in de cultuurgeschiedenis van deze tijd? We combineren hier het verwerven van kennis over de Nederlandse geschiedenis met het analyseren van cultuurhistorische bronnen. Tegelijk leer je hoe de cultuurhistorische benadering zich onderscheidt van andere subdisciplines binnen de geschiedwetenschap. Wat is eigenlijk cultuur en hoe kun je die analyseren?
In week 5 wordt de door jou opgedane kennis en inzicht getoetst in een schriftelijk tentamen.
In week 6 en 7 werk je aan een thema waarover je een status quaestionis schrijft. Tijdens de colleges bespreken we aan de hand van presentaties en discussies hoe je hier een echt betoog van maakt.",Werkcolleges 2x 2 uur.,"Participatie: aanwezigheid en opdrachten (10%), tentamen (50%), Schriftelijke opdracht (40%).",Wordt via Canvas bekendgemaakt.,Studenten BA2 Geschiedenis,BA1 Academische Vaardigheden

De studenten leren de belangrijkste benaderingen, theorieën en concepten kennen die in de historiografie van de Holocaust gehanteerd worden.
Zij krijgen inzicht in de wijze waarop de herinnering aan de Holocaust en andere genocides wordt overgedragen en hoe de post-genocidale samenleving met haar verleden omgaat.
De studenten leren geschreven en mondelinge getuigenissen kritisch te analyseren en krijgen kennis over de voortgaande discussie over de waarde van getuigenissen als historische bron.
De studenten leren onderzoek te doen in verschillende archieven (voor zover externe omstandigheden dat toelaten) en leren hoe ze verschillende bronnen kunnen evalueren en combineren om tot een goed beeld van een gebeurtenis te komen.
De studenten leren schriftelijk en mondeling verslag doen van onderzoek dat individueel of in groepsverband is uitgevoerd.","In dit college in periode 4 staat de Holocaust en de doorwerking ervan centraal. Speciale aandacht gaat uit naar de rol van getuigenissen in de herinnering en de geschiedschrijving en naar de waarde daarvan als historische bron. Daarbij komen ook de geschiedenis en nasleep van andere genocides aan de orde, en de verschillen en overeenkomsten daartussen. Studenten werken via opdrachten mee aan onderzoeksprojecten: over onderduiklocaties van Joden, Roma en Sinti in Europa; en over de gang van zaken voorafgaand, tijdens en na de Jodenvervolging in grotere en kleinere provincieplaatsen 1925-1950.

As it is impossible to cover all Anglo-American writing of this time-period in just seven weeks, we will focus on one specific genre: travel writing. This literary genre, which has been popular for centuries, has been much overlooked by academics and those constituting the British and American literary canons. New critical paradigms such as Transnationalism, Globalization, and Decolonization, however, necessitate a new and serious look at these texts.
We will close-read and analyze travel narratives written by authors who have produced some of the canonical texts from 'the long 19th century' (British and American), such as Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson and Margaret Fuller. In addition, we will close-read and analyze travel narratives written by authors who have been excluded from the literary canon, such as Mary Jane Seacole, Zilpha Elaw and Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins. We will discuss the major developments in the genre of (British and American) travel writing between the late 18th and early 20th century.
The course will address three themes:
Sensations of travel (weeks 1 - 2)
Taking risks (weeks 3 - 4)
The politics of travel (weeks 5 - 6)","The class sessions (4 hours per week) will consist of:
plenary and group discussions. All sessions will be interactive sessions. The lecturer will not summarize the assigned readings; you must come to class prepared, and be able to discuss the assigned texts with your fellow students and instructor. If you have not been able to prepare for class, you should either skip the session or notify the instructor before class (via mail).
joint close-readings of the assigned texts. The instructor will distribute hard copies for in-class close-readings. These are 'teacher’s copies' that you will have to return at the end of each session. The idea behind this is that group and class discussions may benefit from focused readings without other distractions.

Time investment for reading the assigned texts:
The total number of hours you will need when taking this course: 20 hours per week (students enrolled in L&S take two courses per block -> 40 : 2 = 20 hours per week).
This number is roughly divided as follows:
4 hours: classroom hours
16 hours: self-study (including writing a weekly Canvas post; preparing for exam)
Please note:
The 16-hour calculation is an average number. Some weeks you will spent more hours on self-study than others.

Metabolomics is a rapidly emerging field in molecular biology, and is one of the so-called omics technologies (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Metabolomics measures small molecules – the metabolites – in the cell or organism with the aim of determining the health status. But it can also determine the influence of the environment on health, for example through diet or exposure to toxic substances. Examples of metabolites are amino acids, ATP, sugars, neurotransmitters, lipids, etc.\nMetabolomics aims to measure the complete set of metabolites (the metabolome) in organisms and is widely used in the medical, toxicological, and biological field. Metabolites function in a network and are transported to the desired destination via the streets as in a city. Metabolites have a major influence on the phenotype, behavior but also on the development of organisms.\nThis course aims to provide insight into the principles of metabolism in organisms, how metabolomics can be used in practice, how metabolites can be determined in organisms, and how the large amount of data can be handled, processed, visualized and statistically analysed (Big data analysis). The course has a practical approach and consists of lectures followed by a metabolomics experiment (practical). The practical is an important part of the course in which the student will conduct an experiment with zebrafish eggs and determine metabolites in the zebrafish embryos. Another important part is the processing of the large amount of data generated by using data visualization and statistical tools (introduction to processing of Big Data).\nThe following topics are covered:\nWhat is metabolomics\nWhat are metabolic networks\nBasic principles and workflows for determining and processing metabolite data\nMethods for the analysis of metabolites\nApplications of metabolomics\nSetting up a metabolomics experiment\nProcessing and analysis of large data (visualization, metabolite networks, statistical analysis)\nThe practical is an important part of the course to give the student a better insight into the various aspects of metabolomics.

If the ring is a polynomial ring in one variable with coefficients in a field then the corresponding statement for a finitely generated module over it can be used to give a standard form for a square matrix with coefficients in the field (its rational canonical form). Moreover, there exists an algorithm over the polynomial ring to compute this form for a given matrix.","The honours extension consists of studying (mostly independently) the relevant material of Chapters 10 and 12 in the book by Dummit and Foote, including working out various examples, proofs, and exercises, and writing a report on this.","A written report, which will be judged on mathematical correctness and clarity of presentation.","Parts of Chapters 10 and 12 of David S.

Getting acquainted with \""famous texts\"": for each movement you can indicate why a particular text fragment from the tradition of political philosophy is typical or foundational for a particular political-philosophical movement.\n4. Analysis of current ‘hot topics’ in the public-political sphere: you will study a number of current social themes and learn to recognize how different schools of thought think about these issues. You will also learn to formulate and argue your own point of view, in an interdisciplinary context with students from other VU-faculties.\nSkills:\n5. Learning to identify key points in the study material: every week you write a short reflection on readings.\n6. Debating skills: a round of debates is held every week in which we try to determine the 'solving potential' of a particular school of thought for an urgent social problem. You will make a brief analysis of this problem on the basis of internet, newspapers and magazine articles and statistical data and you will learn to introduce the results of your analysis briefly and (hopefully) convincingly in a debate.\n7. Dialogue and reflection: In the VU-wide Broader Mind Course associated with this course you learn to approach personal and social themes from various disciplinary perspectives, to reflect on them and to discuss these themes with students from very different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds."", ""Course Content\nPolitical philosophy or political theory (often used interchangeably) deals with hot topics in today’s society. Together we explore the ideas and visions that people use when designing, redesigning or assessing the way their society is organized. In this course you get to know the most important past and contemporary ideologies within the modern political spectrum, such as liberalism, socialism, feminism, ecological thinking. We also look - particularly during the lectures - at the historical-cultural background of these ideologies: where do they come from, what are the core ideas?\nAnd we practice as well public debates, and reflecting on your own opinions, together with people from very different backgrounds. Listening is as important as talking. This is partly done in the lectures, partly in the university-wide Broader Mind Course, which is associated with this course.\nWe always try to do this in an informed, academic way: arguments are key. But in the selection of arguments political ideologies are important maps for people. In the past, from Plato, but certainly in modern times, all kinds of ideas and visions have been formed that inspire people and on which people rely on in dealing with issues in society.\nThe course has two parts. The main part will be offered in Period 1. Next to this you will participate, with your philosophical background acquired in Period 1, in the university-wide offered Broader Mind Course, which is organized in the spring (period 4 and 5, in total 40 hours), in which you will meet students from all faculties of the VU and together work on and discuss themes that focus on personal development and societal challenges (and the relations between those). Through a smart mix of online assignments and carefully scheduled meet-ups is the Broader MInd Course organized in such a way that it can be very well combined with other courses.\nIn the main course, we will study poltical ideologies and apply these already to current societal issues as well as to some themes that will be discussed as well in the Broader Mind Course. What do the various political ideologies have to say on inequality, on climate change, on abortion rights, on drugs use, on education? You may self choose the topic that you want to explore and discuss. them. Discussions will take place as 'talkshows'."", ""Additional Information Teaching Methods\nIn Period 1: Watching videoclips on the main materials, class discussions and collective readings, debates/talkshows. The Broader Mind part consists of 'blended learning': online assignments, to be fullfilled at a time of your own choosing, and offline meetups in interdisciplinary groups of 25 students, working together on experience-based learning assignments. In total the Broader MInd part will take about 40 hours, over 4 months, so about 2,5 hours per week, no activities in exam periods.\nIf for certain reasons it really is not possible to take the Broader Mind Course in the Spring, there is a special Autumn group that can take this course simultaneously the current couse in the first semester."", ""Method of Assessment\nWritten assignments and participation in talkshows (both: pass/ fail), meant to practice goals 4,5, 6\nWritten exam that will determine your grade (Goals 1,2,3)\nBroader Mind certificate which will validate your grade (achieving goals 4,6,7)"", ""Literature\nKey reading is Andrew Heywood, Political Ideologies.

3. Getting acquainted with ""famous texts"": for each movement you can indicate why a particular text fragment from the tradition of political philosophy is typical or foundational for a particular political-philosophical movement.
4. Analysis of current ‘hot topics’ in the public-political sphere: you will study a number of current social themes and learn to recognize how different schools of thought think about these issues. You will also learn to formulate and argue your own point of view, in an interdisciplinary context with students from other VU-faculties.
Skills:
5. Learning to identify key points in the study material: every week you write a short reflection on readings.
6. Debating skills: a round of debates is held every week in which we try to determine the 'solving potential' of a particular school of thought for an urgent social problem. You will make a brief analysis of this problem on the basis of internet, newspapers and magazine articles and statistical data and you will learn to introduce the results of your analysis briefly and (hopefully) convincingly in a debate.
7. Dialogue and reflection: In the VU-wide Broader Mind Course associated with this course you learn to approach personal and social themes from various disciplinary perspectives, to reflect on them and to discuss these themes with students from very different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds.","Political philosophy or political theory (often used interchangeably) deals with hot topics in today’s society. Together we explore the ideas and visions that people use when designing, redesigning or assessing the way their society is organized. In this course you get to know the most important past and contemporary ideologies within the modern political spectrum, such as liberalism, socialism, feminism, ecological thinking. We also look - particularly during the lectures - at the historical-cultural background of these ideologies: where do they come from, what are the core ideas?
And we practice as well public debates, and reflecting on your own opinions, together with people from very different backgrounds. Listening is as important as talking. This is partly done in the lectures, partly in the university-wide Broader Mind Course, which is associated with this course.
We always try to do this in an informed, academic way: arguments are key. But in the selection of arguments political ideologies are important maps for people. In the past, from Plato, but certainly in modern times, all kinds of ideas and visions have been formed that inspire people and on which people rely on in dealing with issues in society.
The course has two parts. The main part will be offered in Period 1. Next to this you will participate, with your philosophical background acquired in Period 1, in the university-wide offered Broader Mind Course, which is organized in the spring (period 4 and 5, in total 40 hours), in which you will meet students from all faculties of the VU and together work on and discuss themes that focus on personal development and societal challenges (and the relations between those). Through a smart mix of online assignments and carefully scheduled meet-ups is the Broader MInd Course organized in such a way that it can be very well combined with other courses.
In the main course, we will study poltical ideologies and apply these already to current societal issues as well as to some themes that will be discussed as well in the Broader Mind Course. What do the various political ideologies have to say on inequality, on climate change, on abortion rights, on drugs use, on education? You may self choose the topic that you want to explore and discuss. them. Discussions will take place as 'talkshows'.","In Period 1: Watching videoclips on the main materials, class discussions and collective readings, debates/talkshows. The Broader Mind part consists of 'blended learning': online assignments, to be fullfilled at a time of your own choosing, and offline meetups in interdisciplinary groups of 25 students, working together on experience-based learning assignments. In total the Broader MInd part will take about 40 hours, over 4 months, so about 2,5 hours per week, no activities in exam periods.
If for certain reasons it really is not possible to take the Broader Mind Course in the Spring, there is a special Autumn group that can take this course simultaneously the current couse in the first semester.","Written assignments and participation in talkshows (both: pass/ fail), meant to practice goals 4,5, 6

The significance of the KrV for the history of philosophy can hardly be overestimated. Kant's conception of ‘transcendental philosophy’ aims to supply philosophy with a completely new foundation, namely a ‘critical’ foundation.

Hence, Kant’s KrV not only establishes a new philosophical paradigm but at the same time positions this paradigm within the history of philosophy. For many philosophers, Kant’s transcendental philosophy showed to be a source, a standard, and of course an instance that is in need of criticism itself.

A. Kennis en inzicht:
1) Kennis van en inzicht in het hedendaagse politieke en politiek-filosofische landschap: je bent in staat de belangrijkste stromingen binnen de hedendaagse politieke filosofie en het hedendaagse politieke landschap te herkennen, er de kernpunten van aan te geven en aan te geven hoe de verschillende stromingen zich tot elkaar verhouden.
2) Wijsgerige analyse: je kunt doorvragen naar de dragende vooronderstellingen onder de diverse stromingen en deze vooronderstellingen kritisch analyseren.
3) Kennismaken met ‘beroemde teksten’: je kunt bij elke stroming aangeven waarom een bepaald tekstfragment uit de traditie van de politieke filosofie typerend of grondleggend is voor een bepaalde politiek-filosofische stroming.
4) Actualiteitsanalyse: je verdiept je in een aantal actuele maatschappelijke thema’s en leert te herkennen hoe vanuit verschillende stromingen gedacht wordt over deze thema’s. Hierbij leer je ook op basaal niveau beargumenteerd een eigen standpunt in te nemen, in een interdisciplinaire context met studenten vanuit heel andere faculteiten van de VU.
B. Vaardigheden:
5) Identificeren van hoofdlijnen: elke week schrijf je een korte reflectie op de stof
6) Debatvaardigheden: wekelijks wordt er een debatronde gehouden waarin we met elkaar trachten het ‘oplossend potentieel’ van een bepaalde stroming te bepalen voor een nader te bepalen urgent maatschappelijk probleem. Hierbij oefen je in het analyseren van een maatschappelijk thema aan de hand van internet, kranten en tijdschriftartikelen en statistische gegevens en leer je de resultaten van je analyse kort en (hopelijk) overtuigend in te brengen in een debat.
7) Dialoog en reflectie: in de met deze cursus verbonden VU-brede Broader Mind Course leer je persoonlijke en maatschappelijke thema's vanuit heel verschillende disciplinaire invalshoeken te benaderen en hierover persoonlijk te reflecteren en in gesprek te gaan met studenten vanuit heel verschillende disciplinaire en culturele achtergronden.","Politieke filosofie of politieke theorie (wordt vaak door elkaar gebruikt) is volop verbonden met actuele vraagstukken in de huidige samenleving.

For this, we will discuss the processes behind natural selection, sexual selection, neutral evolution, and co-evolution. We will discuss sexual selection and its role in shaping sexual dimorphism and partner choice, which is a prominent feature of human biology. You yourself will be a participant in an (online) evolutionary biology experiment to investigate the evolution of vocal frequency and how this is linked to attractiveness and partner choice. This will provide you with the opportunity to analyze the data from this experiment yourself, and evaluate the experimental design and conclusions drawn based on the results by discussing with peers. As genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection, we will also discuss the source of this variation, and how differences in genetic variation (genetic distance) between populations can emerge over time due to selection and neutral evolution. The lectures and assignments on these topics will provide you with a basic understanding of population genetics. Phylogenetic analysis also plays an essential role evolutionary biology to be able to infer ancestral relations among species or individuals. Lectures, assignments and a work group will explain the principles of multiple approaches, and will allow you to apply this knowledge by reconstructing phylogenies yourself. Finally, we will discuss all the concepts mentioned above within the context of the evolution of pathogens and host defenses. This will demonstrate how evolutionary analysis can be applied in a biomedical context.\nModule 1 will be assessed by a digital partial exam using multiple choice questions.\nModule 2, ~week 4-8\nThe emphasis of module 2 is on providing a broad evolutionary perspective of human anatomy, life-history, physiology, cognition and behavior. For this we will first provide you with an overview of when and why different aspects of animal body plans have evolved, such as the reproductive system and the heart. As development plays a key role in the evolution of body plans, we will give you more insight into the mechanisms that control this stage of life cycle and that can give rise to its diversity. Next, we will discuss the causes and consequences of specific adaptation to human reproduction and longevity, which are associated with patterns in aging and cancer incidence. Also, we will discuss a set of defining human characteristics, such as our cognitive abilities, sociality and culture.

We will discuss sexual selection and its role in shaping sexual dimorphism and partner choice, which is a prominent feature of human biology. You yourself will be a participant in an (online) evolutionary biology experiment to investigate the evolution of vocal frequency and how this is linked to attractiveness and partner choice. This will provide you with the opportunity to analyze the data from this experiment yourself, and evaluate the experimental design and conclusions drawn based on the results by discussing with peers. As genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection, we will also discuss the source of this variation, and how differences in genetic variation (genetic distance) between populations can emerge over time due to selection and neutral evolution. The lectures and assignments on these topics will provide you with a basic understanding of population genetics. Phylogenetic analysis also plays an essential role evolutionary biology to be able to infer ancestral relations among species or individuals. Lectures, assignments and a work group will explain the principles of multiple approaches, and will allow you to apply this knowledge by reconstructing phylogenies yourself. Finally, we will discuss all the concepts mentioned above within the context of the evolution of pathogens and host defenses. This will demonstrate how evolutionary analysis can be applied in a biomedical context.
Module 1 will be assessed by a digital partial exam using multiple choice questions.
Module 2, ~week 4-8
The emphasis of module 2 is on providing a broad evolutionary perspective of human anatomy, life-history, physiology, cognition and behavior. For this we will first provide you with an overview of when and why different aspects of animal body plans have evolved, such as the reproductive system and the heart. As development plays a key role in the evolution of body plans, we will give you more insight into the mechanisms that control this stage of life cycle and that can give rise to its diversity. Next, we will discuss the causes and consequences of specific adaptation to human reproduction and longevity, which are associated with patterns in aging and cancer incidence. Also, we will discuss a set of defining human characteristics, such as our cognitive abilities, sociality and culture. Throughout this module, we will discuss the medical consequences of our evolutionary history, essentially providing you with an overview of the field of Darwinian medicine.
Module 2 will be assessed by digital partial exam 2 using multiple choice questions.
Journal club
In the second half of the course, we will also organize a Journal Club in which you will present a scientific paper to your peers. Being able to process and communicate about research data is a critical part of Science. Presenting a scientific paper will train you to read and discuss scientific articles with your peers and will provide you practice and experience in oral presentation skills. To support you in this, the Journal Club will be preceded by a workgroup to help you prepare. For this workgroup, you will receive an article on a human evolutionary biology topic. During a workgroup each article is discussed and you’ll prepare a presentation on the topic of your paper with a small group of students. Subsequently, during the journal club groups of students will present their studied paper and discuss the papers presented by other groups. The presentations count towards the final grade, and will be scored on scientific content and presentation skills using a rubric.","Lectures: 26 hours

In the Philosophy of Science unit, students will develop the ability to reflect critically on the nature and practice of science, with an emphasis on biomedical sciences. Topics to be covered include the distinction between science and pseudoscience, the nature of scientific progress, the role of values in science, and the relationship between scientific theories and reality. In the Ethics unit, students will explore various ethical issues raised by the practice of biomedical science and the use of products and technologies developed by biomedical scientists.

Acquire research capabilities (formulating a research question and methodology, literature analysis, analysis, integration and reporting of the research results)
Learn to cooperate in a project group and give and receive feed back
Learn about the causes and effects of the complexity of health care innovation processes.
The course allows you to further orientate on your study.","As a student with a biomedical or health care background you certainly will be confronted in your career with medical innovations. These can be technological innovations (new drugs, use of big data), innovation of health care processes and innovations at the system level (finance and cooperation in and between organisations). Many actors are involved in innovations in the health care sector: care givers, patients, policy makers, insurance companies, societal organisations and industry. Their different perspectives and interests make innovation even more difficult…
The course Management of Innovations covers the central concepts of innovation processes in health care: technology and innovation, the strategies of different actors, portfolio management, financial aspects, adoption factors for innovations and the role of vested interests. In the assignment you work in a small group to analyse and improve a medical innovation of your choice and present the results in the form of a report and a poster.","Lectures (h): 25 hours (25 contact hours)

We will discuss the modelling of verbally-described practical problems using appropriate mathematical formulations - in particular, linear optimization and integer linear optimization models. Extremely powerful software tools for solving such models, and they are widely used in industry. We will see the basic algorithmic principles upon which these software tools are based: in particular, the simplex method for linear optimization, and building on this, the branch-and-bound method for integer linear optimization.
Many problems have specific structure that can be exploited to obtain much faster algorithms. We will see this in two contexts:
Network optimization problems. What is the shortest way to get between two nodes in a network? Or the cheapest way to build a road network between a given collection of cities so that all cities are connected? We will develop efficient algorithms for these (and similar) problems.
Dynamic programming. This is a fundamental technique in computer science. Determining whether and in which way this technique can be applied to a given problem is challenging, but it can provide extremely fast algorithms.","Lectures: 4 hours per week. Tutorials: 3 hours per week. During lectures the material will be presented based on the book and supplementary lecture notes. In the tutorials, students will work on the exercises themselves and have the opportunity to get help from the teaching assistants. The last part of a few tutorials will be reserved to a small selection of exercises (pretest) to be handed in for grading. Students can work in small groups (2 or 3 per group) on these pretests.","At most 3 pretests which will be scheduled during the tutorials. If the student participates in all 3 pretests then the best 2 pretest results will count for the pretest average. The pretest average may comprise 10 % of the final grade if the pretest average is higher than the exam grade. A student has to participate in at least 2 pretests for the possibility to use (for 10 %) the pretest average in computation of the final grade.
A written exam will constitute the remaining 90% (or 100 % if pretest average is not counted) of the final grade.","H. Taha. Operations Research: An Introduction (10th Edition).

Therefore, students are expected to be aware of the opportunities for further study and employment after completing the Bachelor’s programme and the Study and Career part.\nAt the end of the Study and Career course, students will:\nhave a better understanding of who they are (interests, skills, values, personal style) in relation to orientation towards further studies and the job market;\nknow better what they want in terms of their further studies and profession, such as: what important is in their work, what brings job satisfaction, which work environment suits them;\nhave formulated the steps they need to take to be more likely to enter their desired program and / or profession;\nknow how to use the following tools that will assist them in their orientation towards possible further studies and the job market:\n- vacancy analysis;\n- asking questions;\n- SWOT analysis;\n- STARR method;\n- informational interviews;\n- In-house day;\n- network: professional and private;\nhave written or improved their curriculum vitae;\nhave written a cover letter;\nhave done an informational interview.\nAcademic writing (Period 5)\nThe aim of Academic writing is to provide students with the essential linguistic know-how for writing the report of their business case, focusing particularly on the introduction. Students will learn how to write in English that is well-organised, idiomatically correct, stylistically appropriate and grammatically accurate.\nBy the end of the course, students will\nunderstand how to structure a scientific article, with a focus on the introduction\nidentify the information elements of different parts of their business case report;\nproduce clear and well-structured texts on complex subjects;\ncite sources effectively;\nwrite well-structured and coherent paragraphs;\nconstruct effective sentences;\nunderstand collocations and how to use them appropriately;\nadopt the appropriate style (formal style, cohesive style, conciseness)\navoid the pitfalls in English grammar;\nuse punctuation marks correctly;\nrecognize their own strengths and weaknesses are in writing;\nprovide effective peer feedback.\nFinal texts may contain occasional spelling, grammatical or word choice errors, however, these should not distract from the general effectiveness of the text.\nBusiness Case (Period 5 and 6)\nThe aim of the Business Case is to provide experience in applying business analytics, which incorporates basic principles from the fields of mathematics and computer science, in a multidisciplinary real business context. This involves modelling business processes using methods from the aforementioned fields with an eye for ethics. Therefore, students need to have a thorough theoretical and practical knowledge of the broad field of mathematics and computer science as applied in commercial and industrial processes. In addition, students must have knowledge of and experience with a selection of mathematical software packages that are commonly used in business and industry, and understand the principles of business economics.\nStudents learn to understand the use of the different subjects and skills and improve them within the context of the business problem. They are aware of the roles that mathematics, computer science, business economics/econometrics and social skills play in other sciences and in society. Therefore, they gain experience working on a business problem in their multidisciplinary group. During the Business Case they become familiar with basic research skills in their Business Case group.

compare performance against prior periods or other firms;
support managerial decisions about prices, production, and employee performance.
After having finished Accounting I you:
can explain the basic theories and concepts of financial and managerial accounting and explain the difference between financial and managerial accounting (Academic & Research Skills);
can explain what type of information management of a company needs in order to make decisions (Academic & Research Skills);
can explain how the core financial statements are construed and how they relate to each other (Academic & Research Skills);
can explain how the most important accounting methods are applied in practice (Bridging Theory & Practice);
can analyze and interpret financial information for decision-making (Bridging Theory & Practice);
are informed about current accounting practices and understand that accounting is not static but being affected and influenced by current affairs, changing norms and values, and new insights (Broadening your Horizon).","Accounting is the language that allows to do business. It allows executives, managers and employees to communicate how an organization is doing; it allows investors, analysts, and governmental authorities to understand how an organization is doing.
Accounting is much more than bookkeeping. Without accounting, it is not possible to evaluate a new business opportunity, assess the performance of a company, or design a solid business strategy for the near future. This course provides a thorough introduction to financial and managerial accounting and provides you with important tools to report and analyze accounting information.
This course teaches how to formally record and report economic events and transactions, how to read accounting information to make inferences and support decisions, and how accounting plays an active role in the success or failure of a company. The course also explains that the accounting activity involves discretion in how information is recorded and reported. Moreover, the course offers a first look at what the accounting profession entails.","Knowledge clips

We put particular emphasis on managing people in the international context. On the one hand, it is argued that a lot of human behavior in organizations tends to be universal, for example, the ways in which people can be motivated, the attitudes and emotions they bring to work, or people’s resistance to change. On the other hand, it is argued that a lot of human behavior in organizations tends to be context-dependent, for example, how people deal with conflicts and leadership or which values and beliefs they bring to work.

This course introduces you to psychological concepts and theories (e.g., motivation, leadership, and inclusion) and engages you in a critical discussion on their application for managing people in organizations (e.g., how does motivation matter for employee performance management?; what is good team leadership?; and how can organizations manage diversity through inclusion?). We put particular emphasis on managing people in the international context. On the one hand, it is argued that a lot of human behavior in organizations tends to be universal, for example, the ways in which people can be motivated, the attitudes and emotions they bring to work, or people’s resistance to change. On the other hand, it is argued that a lot of human behavior in organizations tends to be context-dependent, for example, how people deal with conflicts and leadership or which values and beliefs they bring to work. Throughout this course we will shed light on how the international context influences people’s behavior in organizations and will further explore this reciprocal relationship between human behavior and the role of context.","Lectures (including guest lectures)

Prototypical examples in an international context are the following:
Outsourcing production to developing countries with lower labor costs, while laying off long-term employees in the home country, brings up ethical concerns.
Companies must decide whether to adhere to home country standards, host country standards, or a compromise when the work conditions in the host nation are inferior.
Ethical challenges might arise because fundamental rights such as freedom of association, speech, assembly, and movement are not upheld to the same extent worldwide.
Compared to the home nation, weaker environmental regulations in host nations can lead to ethical issues, including the overuse and degradation of shared resources and common goods.
The growing perception that multinationals are responsible for managing a sustainable global supply chain presents specific ethical challenges and calls for a more rigorous and accountable notion of corporate social responsibility.

Moral and philosophical fundamentals of a (good) society;
Moral and philosophical fundamentals of the economy;

Starting from the concept of ‘modernity’ (which also comprises anti-modernist tendencies), this course addresses different cultural developments in their socio-economic context.\nQuestions addressed include: How did new tools and technical means of (re)production such as photography and film contribute to new ways of looking and representation? How did our views on ‘realism’ change? Which effects did ‘the modernist project’ have as a product and symptom of rationalization, industrialization and mass consumption?

In the first part of the course, we will examine foundational questions in the ethics of responsibility:
What is the relationship between normative ethics (what’s right or wrong) and moral responsibility (who’s to blame or praise)?
How should we distinguish between different kinds of responsibility?
What do classic debates about freedom of the will and determinism tell us about responsibility?
What is blame, and when is it warranted or unjustified?

The course is guided by the question of to what extent, and how, the current process of globalization is changing the nature and content of global politics, approaching this question from the various competing theoretical perspectives IR has to offer. Traditionally, the object of study for IR has been the conflict between and cooperation of sovereign states. This model is, however, increasingly regarded as outdated inasmuch as more and more non-state actors such as multinationals, NGOs, and transnational social movements appear to play a prominent role in world politics. In addition, we can also observe transnational forms of regulation through international organizations and the emerging structures of what is called ‘global governance’. The question has been raised whether in the face of these processes of globalization and transnationalization, states have lost the sovereignty that used to be the basis of the international system. Yet, there are still many instances where state power is very visible. Recent geopolitical developments and events related to, for instance, the rise of China have also once more brought home the message that classical themes of interstate rivalry and international security have not lost their relevance in this new era. In this course the focus will be on seeking to understand these broader questions through various theoretical lenses, as well as to address contemporary issues within global politics such as postcolonialism, international law, and the UN. Alongside the lecture series, students will work in groups in the seminars on contemporary case-studies, learning to apply relatively abstract theories and concepts to concrete questions.

The course is guided by the question of to what extent, and how, the current process of globalization is changing the nature and content of global politics, approaching this question from the various competing theoretical perspectives IR has to offer. Traditionally, the object of study for IR has been the conflict between and cooperation of sovereign states. This model is, however, increasingly regarded as outdated inasmuch as more and more non-state actors such as multinationals, NGOs, and transnational social movements appear to play a prominent role in world politics. In addition, we can also observe transnational forms of regulation through international organizations and the emerging structures of what is called ‘global governance’. The question has been raised whether in the face of these processes of globalization and transnationalization, states have lost the sovereignty that used to be the basis of the international system. Yet, there are still many instances where state power is very visible. Recent geopolitical developments and events related to, for instance, the rise of China have also once more brought home the message that classical themes of interstate rivalry and international security have not lost their relevance in this new era. In this course the focus will be on seeking to understand these broader questions through various theoretical lenses, as well as to address contemporary issues within global politics such as postcolonialism, international law, and the UN. Alongside the lecture series, students will work in groups in the seminars on contemporary case-studies, learning to apply relatively abstract theories and concepts to concrete questions. In addition, students will be writing a short assignment on a pertinent question related to global politics.",Lectures and seminars (active learning groups).,"Written exam (60%) - Corresponds with learning objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4
